# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The agent was defeated because it made a critical tactical error. It entered the turn with `Low HP` and had a `Heal` ability ready, but chose to use `LightAttack` instead. This offensive action, while successful, did not change the outcome of the battle and left the agent vulnerable to the enemy's next attack, which was fatal.

The root cause is a flaw in the Behaviour Tree's decision-making priorities. The BT incorrectly prioritized dealing minor damage over ensuring its own survival, indicating a lack of a proper "self-preservation" or "danger state" check.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement a High-Priority Heal Condition:** The BT's first check should be for survival. Create a condition that runs before any offensive logic: If `Player HP` is `Low` AND `Heal` is `READY`, the BT must execute the `Heal` action.
    *   **Reasoning**: This ensures that survival is always the top priority. Preventing defeat is more important than dealing a small amount of damage. This change directly corrects the mistake seen in the log.

2.  **Create a "Danger State" Selector:** Restructure the BT with a top-level Selector that first evaluates a "Defensive/Survival" branch. This branch would activate if `Player HP` is below a critical threshold (e.g., 35%). Inside this branch, actions like `Heal` or `Defend` would be prioritized.
