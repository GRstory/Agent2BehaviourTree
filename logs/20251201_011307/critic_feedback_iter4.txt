The defeat was a direct result of a critical failure in Turn 1. The Behaviour Tree (BT) attempted to use `Heal` while it was on cooldown, wasting a turn when the player was at low health. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the `CanHeal()` condition; it does not seem to be correctly checking the ability's cooldown status.

Furthermore, the BT's logic is overly defensive. It chose to `Defend` in Turn 0 at "Mid" HP, which allowed the boss to deal damage uncontested, putting the player in a dangerous position. The decision to heal is also too reactive, waiting until HP is critically low (30%) before acting.
