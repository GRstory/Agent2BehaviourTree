# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died due to a combination of low HP and the inability to heal because of the cooldown. The BT prioritizes damage over survival, leading to risky attacks even when the player's health is critically low. Defending seems to be triggered too late or in situations where healing would be more beneficial. The reliance on light attacks as a default action might not be optimal in all scenarios, especially when the enemy is at low health.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Prioritize healing more aggressively. Increase the `IsPlayerHPLow` threshold for the healing sequence to 50% to trigger healing earlier. This will give the player more buffer.
2.  Introduce a condition to check if the enemy is about to perform a heavy attack before defending. This could involve a new condition like `IsEnemyChargingHeavyAttack()` (not in DSL, but conceptually). This would make the Defend action more strategically useful.
3.  Add a sequence that checks if the enemy is at very low health (e.g., below 15%) and prioritizes a Heavy Attack to finish them off, regardless of combos. This prevents the player from dying while trying to execute a light attack on a near-dead enemy.
4.  Reorder the BT to prioritize healing over defending when both conditions are met. Currently, if HP is below 40% and healing is available, the BT will attempt to heal. However, if healing is on cooldown, it will default to defending. It might be more beneficial to attempt healing first if available, but if not, then evaluate other options instead of immediately defending.
