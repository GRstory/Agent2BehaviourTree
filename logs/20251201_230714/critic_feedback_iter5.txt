# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5 despite reaching it in the previous iteration. The gameplay log suggests a few issues: the player took significant damage on turns 1 and 2, leading to a low HP state on turn 3. The BT prioritized light attacks even with low HP, and the heal was on cooldown on turn 0 when it was most needed. The BT doesn't seem to account for incoming damage or prioritize defense when necessary.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize Defense:** Add a sequence to the beginning of the selector that checks if the player's HP is low (e.g., below 40%) and if the enemy's HP is high (e.g., above 60%). If both are true, the player should defend. This will help mitigate damage when the player is vulnerable and the enemy is not close to being defeated.
2. **Adjust Healing Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for healing. Currently, it's at 30%. Change it to 50% to trigger healing earlier, giving the player a buffer against incoming damage.
3. **Consider Combo Opportunities:** Add a sequence to check for `HasComboReady(TripleLight)` before defaulting to a light attack. This will ensure that the player utilizes the combo when available for increased damage output.
4. **Early Turn Aggression:** Add a condition `IsTurnEarly(2)` to a sequence that prioritizes HeavyAttack if the enemy HP is high. This allows for an early burst of damage, potentially staggering the enemy and reducing incoming damage later in the fight.
