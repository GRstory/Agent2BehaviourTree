# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on floor 5, indicating a failure to adapt to the damage output of the enemies and a lack of effective healing or defense. The BT prioritizes attacking low HP enemies, but this strategy fails when the player's HP is also low, leading to a downward spiral. The cooldown on healing is a major factor. The current BT doesn't account for combo opportunities.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Increase the player's healing threshold. The current threshold of 30% is too low, especially with a 3-turn cooldown. Change the healing threshold to 50% to trigger healing earlier.

2.  Prioritize defense when healing is on cooldown and HP is low. Add a sequence that checks if `IsPlayerHPLow(40)` and `CanHeal()` is false, then executes `Defend()`. This will increase survivability while waiting for the heal cooldown.

3.  Implement combo usage, specifically for damage. Add a sequence that checks for `HasComboReady(TripleLight)` and executes `LightAttack()`. This will increase damage output and potentially finish off enemies faster, reducing the damage taken.

4.  Consider adding a condition to check if the current floor is a boss floor (`IsFloorBoss()`). If it is, prioritize defense and healing more aggressively. This can be done by adding a selector at the root that first checks `IsFloorBoss()` and then executes a sequence focused on survival (healing/defending), otherwise proceeds with the normal attack-focused logic.
