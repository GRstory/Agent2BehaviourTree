# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player frequently attempts to defend, even when it's not strategically advantageous. This is likely due to the lack of specific conditions for when to defend. The player also fails to capitalize on potential combo opportunities and prioritize damage when the enemy is at a lower health threshold. The constant defending is prolonging the fight, leading to the turn limit being reached. The healing is ineffective due to the cooldown and low HP threshold.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Add a condition to check if a CounterStrike combo is ready before defending. This ensures defends are used offensively.
2.  Increase the healing threshold to 60% to proactively heal before taking significant damage, giving the heal cooldown time to expire.
3.  Add a sequence to prioritize HeavyAttack when the enemy is below 40% HP and no combo is ready. This will help finish the enemy faster.
4.  Implement a check for `IsTurnEarly(5)` and only defend if true. This will help to prioritize damage early in the fight.
