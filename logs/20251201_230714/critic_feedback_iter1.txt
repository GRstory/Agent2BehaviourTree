# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5, indicating a potential issue with boss fights or a general lack of survivability. The gameplay log shows the player took significant damage in the early turns, dropping to 18% HP by Turn 3 despite landing attacks. The current BT prioritizes attacking even at low HP, and the Heal ability was on cooldown when needed most. The player also took avoidable damage.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Prioritize defense at lower health. Insert a sequence that checks if player HP is below 40% and then executes the Defend action. This should come before the attack actions. This will help mitigate damage taken.
2.  Add a condition to check for the `TripleLight` combo readiness before executing light attacks. This ensures that the player completes the combo when available for maximum damage output.
3.  Increase the healing threshold. The current threshold of 30% is too low, leading to a near-death experience before attempting to heal. Increase it to 50% to allow for earlier healing.
4.  Add a condition to check if the current floor is a boss floor. If it is, increase the defense threshold to 60% to prioritize survival. This will help the player survive boss fights, which are likely the cause of death on Floor 5.
