# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5 after defending for three consecutive turns with low HP. The current BT prioritizes healing only when HP is below 30%, but healing was likely on cooldown due to its 3-turn cooldown. The BT doesn't seem to account for incoming damage or proactively defend/heal when HP is getting low. The constant defending without any offensive action prolonged the fight, leading to inevitable defeat.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Increase the healing threshold to 50% HP to trigger healing earlier, allowing for more proactive health management.
2.  Add a condition to check if healing is on cooldown. If it is, and HP is below a certain threshold (e.g., 40%), prioritize defending to mitigate incoming damage while waiting for the heal to become available.
3.  Implement a condition to check if a CounterStrike combo is available after defending. If so, execute a HeavyAttack. This adds offensive capability after defending instead of only defending.
4.  Add a condition to check if the turn is early (e.g., IsTurnEarly(3)). If it is, prioritize Light Attacks to build up to a combo, as the enemy is likely at full health. This avoids wasting resources on defending when damage taken is minimal.
