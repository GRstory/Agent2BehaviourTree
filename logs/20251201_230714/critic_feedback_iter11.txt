# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5 despite reaching it in the previous iteration. The log shows a concerning HP trend. The player started at 25% HP, failed to heal due to cooldown, and took damage on turns 1 and 2, dropping to 18% before finally executing a Triple Light combo on turn 3. The core issue is the low initial HP and inability to heal immediately, combined with taking damage before being able to trigger the combo. The BT prioritizes attacking even when the player is at critical HP and heal is on cooldown.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Defend at Low HP:** Add a sequence at the beginning of the selector that checks if the player is at very low HP (e.g., below 25%) and isn't defending, and then executes a `Defend()` action. This gives a chance to mitigate incoming damage, especially when healing is on cooldown.
2.  **Increase Healing Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for healing from 30% to a higher value, such as 45%. This will trigger healing earlier, preventing the player from dropping to dangerously low HP.
3.  **Consider Combo Disruption:** If a combo is ready but HP is critically low, prioritize defense or healing over completing the combo. Add a condition that checks if HP is below a certain threshold (e.g. 30%) and if so, breaks out of the attack sequence to either defend or heal. This prevents situations where the player dies while trying to complete a combo.
4.  **Early Turn Defense:** Add a sequence that checks if it's an early turn (e.g., turn 1 or 2) and the player's HP is not full (e.g. below 90%) and executes a Defend(). This could help mitigate early damage spikes.
