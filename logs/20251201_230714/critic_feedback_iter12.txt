# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5 despite reaching it in the previous iteration. The gameplay log shows a risky strategy of prioritizing light attacks even at low HP. The BT's healing logic only triggers at 30% HP, which proved insufficient. There was a missed opportunity to defend to mitigate damage, especially when healing was on cooldown. The current BT doesn't account for the damage the player is taking and doesn't prioritize survival enough.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Increase the healing threshold. Change the `IsPlayerHPLow` condition for healing from 30% to 60% to trigger healing earlier.

2.  Add a defense check when healing is on cooldown and HP is low. Insert a sequence that checks if HP is below 40% and `CanHeal()` is false. If both are true, then `Defend()`. This will help mitigate damage when healing is unavailable.

3.  Prioritize defense on boss floors, especially in early turns. Add a sequence at the beginning of the root selector that checks `IsFloorBoss()` and `IsTurnEarly(3)`. If both are true, then `Defend()`. This will reduce the initial damage taken from the boss.

4. Consider adding a condition to check if the enemy is about to attack (if that information is available) and defend if so. This would require a new `IsEnemyAboutToAttack()` condition.
