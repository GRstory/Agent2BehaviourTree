# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on floor 5, indicating a failure to adapt to increasing enemy damage or a lack of proactive healing/defense. The BT prioritizes heavy attacks on low-health enemies, but this aggression might be detrimental when the player's health is also low. The log shows a heal failing due to cooldown, highlighting the need for better heal timing. The player also defended at 27% HP, which could have been a heal if it was available.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Increase the player HP threshold for healing. The current 30% is too low, leading to panic healing when already in critical condition. Change the healing threshold to 50% to allow for more proactive healing.

2.  Prioritize defense at a slightly higher HP threshold, especially when healing is on cooldown. Add a sequence that checks if player HP is below 40% and heal is on cooldown, then defends. This will prevent unnecessary damage when healing is unavailable.

3.  Consider the enemy's attack pattern. Add a condition to check if the player is defending before attempting a Counter Strike combo. This will ensure the player is actually blocking an attack before using the combo, preventing wasted turns.

4.  Introduce a check for floor number. On boss floors (5 and 10), increase the defensive stance, even if the player's HP is not critically low. Add a sequence at the beginning of the BT that checks if it's a boss floor and defends if the player's HP is below 60%.
