# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5 despite reaching it in the previous iteration, indicating a lack of progress and potentially a regression in strategy. The gameplay log shows a critical vulnerability due to low HP and an inability to heal because of the cooldown. The current BT prioritizes attacking low HP enemies over self-preservation, leading to a quick defeat. The lack of defensive actions also contributed to the loss.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize Healing earlier:** Increase the HP threshold for the `IsPlayerHPLow` condition in the healing sequence. Change it from 30% to 60% to trigger healing sooner. This will help ensure the player has a buffer before reaching critical HP levels.

2. **Introduce a Defend action:** Add a sequence that checks if the player's HP is below a certain threshold (e.g., 40%) and executes the `Defend()` action. This will mitigate incoming damage and increase survivability.

3. **Consider enemy attack patterns:** Add a condition to check if the enemy is likely to attack (perhaps based on a simple turn counter or a more sophisticated prediction). If an attack is predicted, prioritize defending.

4. **Delay Heavy Attack for Combos:** Instead of immediately using Heavy Attack when the enemy is low, check if a combo (like HeavyFinisher) is ready. If so, execute the Light Attacks first to trigger the combo and maximize damage output.
