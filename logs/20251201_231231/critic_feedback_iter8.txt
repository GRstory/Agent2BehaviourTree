# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 10, suggesting a struggle to survive. The gameplay log shows a critical situation arising from turn 2 onwards. The player's HP dropped significantly, and relying on Defend twice in a row while at low HP proved insufficient. A key issue is the inability to heal due to cooldown, highlighting a need for better heal management or earlier healing. The BT's aggressive tendencies (LightAttack on Turn 1) when the player is already at 31% HP may be detrimental.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Healing at a Higher HP Threshold:** Increase the `IsPlayerHPLow` threshold for the healing sequence. Currently, it's at 50%, but based on the log, healing should be attempted earlier, perhaps at 70%, to avoid getting into a critical state in the first place.

2.  **Delay Aggressive Attacks When HP is Critically Low:** Add a condition that prevents attacking (LightAttack or HeavyAttack) if the player's HP is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30%). This will force the BT to prioritize survival actions like Defend or Heal.

3.  **Consider Enemy Attack Patterns Before Defending:** Implement a check to determine if the enemy is likely to use a heavy attack on the next turn. If so, prioritize defending. This requires a new condition (e.g., `IsEnemyChargingHeavyAttack()`), which is not currently available, but conceptually, it would improve the efficiency of the Defend action. Alternatively, if this is not possible, defend should only be used if the player is below a certain HP threshold, and not as a general response to low HP.

4.  **Add a check for floor type before attacking:** If the current floor is a boss floor, consider prioritizing defense or healing over attacking, especially in the early turns when the boss's attack pattern is unknown. This could be implemented using the `IsFloorBoss()` condition.
