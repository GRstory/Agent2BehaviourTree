# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player character died on Floor 5, a regression from reaching Floor 7 in the previous iteration. The log shows a pattern of HP dropping low, attempting to heal (often failing due to cooldown), and repeated defending. The primary issue seems to be a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to damage mitigation, leading to inefficient resource usage and death. The BT prioritizes healing only at very low HP, and then falls back to defending, which isn't enough to prevent death. The BT never attacks when the enemy is at low health, meaning that the enemy is not being killed fast enough.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Increase the HP threshold for healing and prioritize it higher in the BT:** The current threshold of 20% is too low. Increase it to 40% or even 50% to allow for more proactive healing and prevent the player from constantly being in critical condition. Move the Heal sequence to the very top of the BT selector.

2. **Implement a Light Attack fallback:** Add a `task : LightAttack()` node as the last child of the root selector. This ensures that the player always performs an action, even if no other conditions are met, preventing wasted turns.

3. **Consider enemy damage output when deciding to defend:** The current BT defends when player HP is low. However, it doesn't take into account the enemy's attack pattern. Add a condition to check if the enemy is about to perform a heavy attack. If so, defend.

4. **Prioritize finishing off low-health enemies:** The current BT attacks when the enemy is at low health. The BT should prioritize Heavy Attacks when the enemy HP is low to finish them off quickly. Move the `IsEnemyHPLow` sequence higher in the selector, before the general defend condition.

5. **Add a check for healing cooldown before defending:** Currently, if healing is on cooldown, the BT immediately defaults to defending. Add a condition to check for the healing cooldown. If the cooldown is short (e.g., 1 turn), consider defending for a turn to enable healing on the next turn.
