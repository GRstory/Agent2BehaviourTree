# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on floor 5. The gameplay log shows a critical issue: the player's HP dropped to 25% on turn 0, but Heal was on cooldown. The BT prioritized light attacks over defense when the player's HP was low and Heal was unavailable. The current BT doesn't account for Heal cooldown and has no defensive strategy when healing is unavailable, leading to a quick death. The player also triggered a Triple Light combo at 18% HP, which is risky and could have been avoided in favor of defense.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Add a Defend action when HP is low and Heal is on cooldown. Insert a sequence that checks `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `NOT CanHeal()` and then executes `Defend()`. This will prioritize defense when healing isn't an option.
2. Increase the healing threshold. Change the `IsPlayerHPLow()` threshold in the healing sequence from 30% to 45%. This gives the player more time to react before HP gets critically low.
3. Prioritize combos less aggressively when HP is low. Add a condition to the `TripleLight` combo sequence that checks `IsPlayerHPHigh(40)`. This prevents the player from triggering a risky combo when their health is dangerously low.
4. Consider adding a condition to check if the floor is a boss floor. If it is, increase the healing threshold and prioritize defense more. Add a condition `IsFloorBoss()` to increase the healing threshold to 60% and prioritize defense when healing is on cooldown.
