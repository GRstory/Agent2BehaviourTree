# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died despite reaching floor 10 again. The log shows a critical failure in resource management and prioritization. The player's HP dropped to critical levels very quickly, and the BT failed to effectively respond, leading to a quick defeat. The player attempted to heal on turn 0, but it was on cooldown. Turns 2 and 3 were spent defending while at very low HP, which didn't prevent the player from taking damage and ultimately dying.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Healing at Critical HP:** Move the healing sequence to the very top of the selector. This ensures that if healing is possible at low HP, it will always be the first action considered.

2.  **Increase Healing Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for healing from 50% to a higher value, such as 70%. This will trigger healing earlier, potentially preventing the player from reaching critically low HP in the first place.

3.  **Consider Enemy Attack Patterns Before Defending:** Add a condition to check if the enemy is likely to perform a heavy attack next turn before defending. This could be implemented by tracking the enemy's previous attack type and predicting the next one. If a heavy attack is predicted, defend. Otherwise, prioritize healing or attacking.

4. **Implement a more aggressive defense strategy when healing is on cooldown:** If the player is at low HP and healing is on cooldown, prioritize defending for multiple turns or until healing becomes available. This could involve adding a sequence that checks for low HP and healing cooldown, then executes the Defend action repeatedly.
