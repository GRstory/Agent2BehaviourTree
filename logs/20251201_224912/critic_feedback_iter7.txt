# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5, indicating that the current strategy is not sufficient for surviving later floors. The gameplay log shows a concerning pattern: the player takes significant damage on turns 1 and 2, dropping to critical HP levels. While a Triple Light combo was executed on turn 3, it wasn't enough to prevent the eventual defeat. The initial Heal failure due to cooldown on turn 0 put the player behind from the start. The BT prioritizes attacking even when the player's HP is critically low and healing is on cooldown.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize defense at low HP, especially early in the fight:** Add a sequence that checks if the player's HP is below a certain threshold (e.g., 40%) and if it's early in the fight (e.g., first 3 turns). If both conditions are true, execute a Defend action. This could mitigate some of the early damage taken.

2. **Increase the healing threshold:** The current healing threshold of 30% seems too low, as the player is consistently taking damage and dropping to critical HP before healing can be attempted. Increase the `IsPlayerHPLow` threshold for the Heal sequence to 50% to trigger healing earlier.

3. **Consider enemy HP when deciding to attack:** The current BT prioritizes attacking low-HP enemies with HeavyAttack, but doesn't consider the player's HP. Add a condition to the `IsEnemyHPLow` sequence to also check if the player's HP is above a certain threshold (e.g., 60%). If the player's HP is too low, prioritize healing or defending instead.

4. **Incorporate Counter Strike combo:** Add a sequence to check if the CounterStrike combo is ready and execute a HeavyAttack if it is. This could provide a damage boost and potentially interrupt enemy attacks. This sequence should be placed before the default LightAttack.
