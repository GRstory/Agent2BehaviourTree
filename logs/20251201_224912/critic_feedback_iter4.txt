# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player consistently chose to defend every turn, even with full HP. This resulted in a stalemate and ultimately a defeat due to exceeding the turn limit. The BT lacks any offensive strategy when the player's HP is high, leading to a purely defensive, and ultimately unsuccessful, approach.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Add a condition to check if the player's HP is high (e.g., > 70%) before considering defense. If HP is high, prioritize attacking.

2. Implement a combo system. Add a sequence that checks for `HasComboReady(TripleLight)` and executes `LightAttack()` to trigger the combo.

3. Introduce a turn limit condition. If the turn count exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 20), prioritize heavy attacks to finish the fight quickly, even if the enemy HP isn't low.

4. Consider adding a condition to check if the enemy is defending. If the enemy is defending, perhaps prioritize a different action (if available) or continue with light attacks to build up to a combo.
