# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on floor 8 with low HP (28%) and a heal cooldown of 1. The BT chose to defend instead of prioritizing healing, even though healing would have been available on the next turn. This suggests a flaw in the prioritization of healing versus defending at low HP. The current BT prioritizes defense if HP is below 50%, but this might be too high, especially when healing is a viable option in the very near future.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Increase the IsPlayerHPLow threshold for the Defend action. Currently, it's at 50%. Change it to 30% to prioritize healing when HP is critically low and healing is almost available. This will prevent the BT from choosing to defend when a heal is a better option on the subsequent turn.

2.  Add a condition to the Heal sequence that checks if the heal will bring the player above a certain HP threshold (e.g., 60%). This prevents the BT from wasting a heal when the player is only slightly below the healing threshold and could survive a turn without it.

3.  Consider adding a condition that checks for the enemy's attack pattern. If the enemy is known to do a heavy attack next turn, defending might be a better option even if the player can heal. This requires more advanced game state awareness, but could significantly improve survivability.
