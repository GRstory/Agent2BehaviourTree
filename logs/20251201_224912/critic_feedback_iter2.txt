# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5 despite reaching it in the previous iteration. The log shows a critical vulnerability to enemy attacks, rapidly depleting HP. The BT's reliance on Light Attacks, even at low HP, proved insufficient for survival. The failed heal attempt on turn 0 due to cooldown highlights a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to healing. The Triple Light combo, while dealing massive damage, didn't prevent the eventual defeat.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Defending at Low HP:** Add a sequence that checks if the player is at low HP (e.g., below 40%) and not currently defending, then executes the Defend action. This should be placed higher in the selector than the LightAttack.
2.  **Proactive Healing:** Instead of only healing when HP is low and `CanHeal()` is true, consider a conditional heal when HP is moderately low (e.g., below 50%) if the heal will be off cooldown by the next turn. This anticipates damage rather than reacting to it.
3.  **Consider Enemy HP Threshold Before Aggression:** Before executing the LightAttack as a default, add a condition that checks if the enemy HP is above a certain threshold (e.g., 60%). If the enemy HP is high, prioritize Defend or another defensive action instead of blindly attacking.
4.  **Counter-Strike Opportunity:** Implement a sequence that checks if `IsDefending()` is true and `HasComboReady(CounterStrike)` is true, then executes `HeavyAttack()`. This leverages the Defend action into a potential damage opportunity.
