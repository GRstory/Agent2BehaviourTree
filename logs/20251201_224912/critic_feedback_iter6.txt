# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on floor 5, indicating a failure to survive the entire floor. The gameplay log reveals a few key issues: Firstly, the player's HP dropped to a critical level (23%) very early in the fight (Turn 1) and the immediate attempt to heal failed due to cooldown. Secondly, the player defaulted to LightAttack, even when the enemy was at a higher HP percentage, which wasn't optimal. Thirdly, the player used Defend twice at 35% and 26% HP respectively, which might not have been the most effective use of resources.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Healing Earlier:** Increase the player HP threshold for the healing condition. Instead of healing at 30% HP, consider healing at 45% or 50% to avoid dropping to critically low health. This will allow more time to recover before being in immediate danger.

2.  **Implement Combo Awareness:** Add conditions to check for combo readiness before defaulting to LightAttack. Specifically, check for `HasComboReady(TripleLight)` or `HasComboReady(HeavyFinisher)` and execute the combo if available. This can increase damage output and potentially end the fight quicker.

3.  **Consider Enemy HP for Attack Choice:** Modify the HeavyAttack condition to consider a higher enemy HP threshold. Currently, it only triggers when the enemy is below 30% HP. Consider triggering HeavyAttack when the enemy is below 60% HP to apply more damage earlier in the fight.

4. **Implement Counter-Strike Combo:** Add a sequence that checks if `IsDefending()` is true and `HasComboReady(CounterStrike)` is true. If both are true, then execute `HeavyAttack()`. This will allow for a more strategic use of Defend and capitalize on the defensive stance.
