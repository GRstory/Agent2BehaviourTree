# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 5, indicating a problem with survivability, especially considering the heal ability was on cooldown at a critical moment. The BT prioritizes attacking over healing, even when at very low HP, and doesn't account for the heal cooldown effectively. Also, there's no defensive strategy in place, making the player vulnerable to damage. The Triple Light combo was triggered, but the player died shortly after, suggesting damage output alone isn't enough for survival.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Prioritize healing more aggressively. Move the healing sequence higher in the selector and consider adding a second healing check with a lower HP threshold (e.g., 50%) before the first one in case the first heal fails due to cooldown.
2.  Implement a defensive strategy. Add a sequence to check if player HP is low (e.g., below 50%) and use `Defend()` if true. This will mitigate incoming damage and increase survivability.
3.  Consider the heal cooldown. Add a condition that checks if `CanHeal()` is false and HP is low, then `Defend()`. This will buy time for the heal to come off cooldown.
4.  Add a condition to check for the boss floor and prioritize defense. Add a sequence that checks `IsFloorBoss()` and `IsPlayerHPLow(60)` then `Defend()`.
