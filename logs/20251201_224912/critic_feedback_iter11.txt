# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on floor 6, indicating that the current BT, while an improvement, still struggles with survivability. The log shows a critical situation on turn 0 where healing was unavailable due to cooldown, leading to a low HP state. The player then took damage on turns 1 and 2, further reducing HP. Defending on turn 3 was too late and ineffective, leading to the player's demise on a subsequent turn (not shown). The BT prioritizes damage over survival in early turns.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize healing earlier:** Move the healing sequence higher in the selector, even if it means delaying damage dealing. This ensures that healing is attempted as soon as it's available and the player is below the HP threshold.

2. **Increase the healing HP threshold:** Raise the `IsPlayerHPLow` threshold for healing from 50% to a higher value like 70%. This will trigger healing earlier, preventing the player from dropping to critically low HP.

3. **Adjust the early turn defense:** Consider removing the `IsTurnEarly` condition from the Defend sequence. Defending should be based on HP, not turn number. If the player is low on HP, they should defend regardless of the turn.

4. **Consider enemy attack patterns:** If information about enemy attack patterns is available (e.g., some enemies always attack on turn 1), integrate this into the BT. For example, if a strong attack is expected on turn 1, consider defending preemptively.

5. **Implement a "desperate defense" condition:** Add a sequence that triggers Defend when HP is extremely low (e.g., below 20%), even if other conditions aren't met. This acts as a last-ditch attempt to survive a turn.
