# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player character exclusively defended for 30 turns, leading to a defeat due to exceeding the turn limit. The Behaviour Tree prioritizes defense too heavily, especially when the player's HP is at 100%. There's a complete lack of offensive actions, preventing any progress in defeating the enemy. The conditions for triggering attacks are either unmet or overshadowed by the defensive conditions. The constant defending also prevents the CounterStrike combo from ever being useful, as it's always defending.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Add a condition to check if the player's HP is high (e.g., IsPlayerHPHigh(90)) before considering defense. This will prevent unnecessary defending when the player is at near full health.
2.  Introduce a turn limit condition for defending. For example, add a sequence that checks `IsTurnEarly(5)` and then executes a defend action. This prevents the AI from defending indefinitely.
3.  Rearrange the order of the selector. Prioritize attacking when the enemy HP is high (e.g., `IsEnemyHPHigh(70)`) before defaulting to defending. This encourages the AI to engage in combat earlier.
4.  Add a sequence to check for combo opportunities (TripleLight or HeavyFinisher) and prioritize executing them. This will increase damage output and potentially shorten the battle.
5.  Reduce the threshold for `IsEnemyHPLow` to encourage more frequent heavy attacks when the enemy is near defeat. A lower threshold like 20 or 15 might be more effective.
