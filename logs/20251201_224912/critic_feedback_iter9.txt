# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 6 after reaching turn 3. The player's HP was critically low (21%) at the start of the fight, but healing was on cooldown. Light attacks were used for the first two turns, and then defend was used when HP was at 27%. The BT prioritized light attacks over survival, and the timing of the defense was too late. The initial low HP state was not handled effectively.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  Prioritize healing more aggressively at the start of combat. Move the healing sequence to the top of the selector so it is checked first, even if the cooldown is not up, to prevent further damage.
2.  Implement an emergency defense mechanism. If healing is on cooldown and HP is critically low (e.g., below 30%), immediately defend regardless of the turn number. This can be achieved by adding a sequence at the top of the selector that checks for low HP and heal cooldown, then executes the defend task.
3.  Increase the healing threshold. The current threshold of 50% might be too low, especially if the player takes significant damage early. Consider increasing it to 60% or 70% to trigger healing earlier.
4.  Evaluate the effectiveness of the `IsTurnEarly` condition for defense. The player's HP dropped significantly in the first few turns, suggesting that defending early might be beneficial even if the turn count is higher. Consider removing or adjusting the `IsTurnEarly` condition to allow for more proactive defense.
