# CRITIC FEEDBACK

## Analysis
The player died on Floor 4 due to a combination of low HP and unavailable healing. The BT prioritized light attacks and combos initially, but failed to adapt to the critical HP situation later on. Defending was used repeatedly at very low HP, but it wasn't enough to prevent death. The BT's healing logic was hampered by cooldowns, and the defend logic didn't prioritize it highly enough when the player was critically low.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. Increase the priority of the `Defend` action when player HP is extremely low (e.g., below 20%). Move the sequence containing the `IsPlayerHPLow(40)` and `IsTurnEarly(3)` condition higher in the selector, or add a new sequence with a lower HP threshold (e.g., `IsPlayerHPLow(20)`) and no turn limit.

2. Add a check to see if the enemy is very low HP (e.g. < 10%) before prioritizing healing or defending. If the enemy is about to die, it might be better to finish them off.

3. Re-evaluate the usefulness of the `IsTurnEarly(3)` condition in the Defend sequence. It might be preventing necessary defensive actions later in the fight when they are most needed. Consider removing it entirely or increasing the turn threshold.

4. Consider adding a condition to check if defending would actually block an attack. If the enemy is charging a heavy attack, defending is more valuable. If the enemy is stunned, defending is less valuable. This requires a new condition, `IsEnemyChargingHeavyAttack()`.

5. If healing is on cooldown, and the player is at critical HP, consider a sequence that prioritizes Defend for multiple turns until healing is available. This could be implemented with a counter that tracks how many turns Defend has been used consecutively.
