SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis

The BT struggled to adapt to the FireGolem's aggressive telegraphing and reliance on the HeavySlam attack. The BT consistently attacked without a defensive response, leading to significant HP loss. Scanning was missed entirely, preventing the BT from identifying the FireGolem's vulnerability and utilizing the IceSpell effectively. The MP was largely wasted on attacks and heals, failing to capitalize on the FireGolem's vulnerability. The Heal action was triggered too late, after the player was already heavily damaged.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Implement Defend() on HeavySlam Telegraph:** Add Defend() to the BT when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam. This will mitigate the damage and buy time for a more strategic response.

2. **Prioritize Scanning on Turn 1:** Immediately after the start of combat, execute the Scan action. This is crucial for identifying the FireGolem's weakness and triggering the IceSpell.

3. **Conditional IceSpell Trigger:** Modify the IceSpell sequence to trigger *immediately* after the Scan action reveals the Fire weakness.  This ensures the IceSpell is used at the optimal moment.  Specifically, add a condition: "HasScannedEnemy() AND EnemyWeakTo(Ice)" before the IceSpell task.

4. **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 50% to 40%. This allows the Heal to be triggered sooner, potentially preventing critical damage.

5. **Introduce a 'Wait' Action:** Add a 'Wait' action (1 turn) after a successful Scan. This gives the BT time to fully process the information and prepare the appropriate response (IceSpell).


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` - Enemy weak to element (DYNAMIC! Can change during combat)
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
