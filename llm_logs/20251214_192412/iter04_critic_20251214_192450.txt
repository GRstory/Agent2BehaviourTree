You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- Elemental weakness: Fire ↔ Ice (1.5x damage)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
  - FireGolem: Phase 2 (HP < 50%) permanently becomes Fire element
  - IceWraith: Using IceSpell grants Ice element for 3 turns, then returns to Neutral
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
- FireGolem: FireSpell adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES:
- vs FireGolem: Use IceSpell (15 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Fire element (Phase 2)
- vs IceWraith: Use FireSpell (11 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Ice element (after IceSpell)
- Cleanse value: Removes Burn (30 dmg saved) OR AttackDown (damage restored) + 10% boost
- Wrong spell = damage loss (7 vs 11-15)
- **CRITICAL**: Check enemy element BEFORE using elemental spells!

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they wait for enemy to gain element before using weakness spell?)
- Elemental advantage (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **IceWraith**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Analysis
The BT failed to adequately react to the telegraphed Debuff on IceWraith. The BT consistently attacked without considering the potential for a debuff, leading to the final state of AttackDown. The BT also didn’t utilize the scan action to identify IceWraith’s weakness, relying solely on a generic “FireSpell” when Ice was the active element. MP usage was reasonable but could have been optimized by prioritizing the most impactful actions (like the IceSpell).

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs Debuff**:  "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs Debuff. This should be the highest priority action when a debuff is telegraphed, preventing the AttackDown effect."

2. **Scan on turn 1**: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2. This will immediately reveal IceWraith's weakness, allowing for the optimal IceSpell to be used from the start."

3. **Prioritize IceSpell on Ice Element**: "Modify the FireSpell condition to prioritize the IceSpell when Ice is the enemy’s active element. Specifically, if the enemy is Ice, execute IceSpell. Otherwise, execute FireSpell. This ensures the most effective damage and potential status effect (Freeze) is used."

4. **Adjust Heal Threshold**: "Increase the heal threshold from 30% to 40%. This allows for more proactive healing, particularly when the player is consistently taking damage from the IceWraith’s FrostTouch."
