SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

        # Scan on turn 1
        sequence :
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        # FireSpell if enemy is weak to Ice after scanning
        sequence :
            condition : HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : EnemyWeakTo(Ice)
            condition : HasMP(20)

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently defended against the HeavySlam telegraph, but failed to capitalize on the FireGolem's eventual transformation into a Fire element. The BT didn't utilize the scan effectively, and the reliance on Defend against the telegraph was predictable and ineffective. MP was used inefficiently, primarily through scanning, when a more aggressive strategy could have been beneficial. The lack of proactive elemental assessment led to wasted spellcasting opportunities.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize Scan on Turn 1:** Immediately execute Scan on turn 1 to reveal the FireGolem's potential for Fire element transformation. This should be the first action taken.
2. **Aggressive Elemental Response:** If Scan reveals Fire element (Phase 2), immediately use IceSpell. This directly addresses the enemy's weakness and prevents the Burn DoT from accumulating.
3. **Defend Only on HeavySlam Telegraph:**  Strictly limit Defend to only when the HeavySlam telegraph is observed. This avoids unnecessary MP expenditure and wasted turns.  Remove the conditional from the Defend task.
4. **Reduce Scan MP Cost:** Lower the MP cost of Scan to 10 instead of 15. This increases its frequency and the likelihood of revealing the Fire element early.
5. **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for Heal from 40% to 50%. This allows for more frequent healing and prevents the player from reaching critical health.

# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` - Enemy weak to element (DYNAMIC! Can change during combat)
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
