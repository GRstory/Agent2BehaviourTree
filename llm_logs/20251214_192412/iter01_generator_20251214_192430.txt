SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

Generate an IMPROVED Behaviour Tree based on feedback.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Scan on turn 1
        sequence :
            NOT HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        # Defend against HeavySlam
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

        # Heal when critical
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # IceSpell if enemy is weak to Ice
        sequence :
            condition : HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : EnemyWeakTo(Ice)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : IceSpell()
        
        # Default: Attack
        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently reacted to telegraphed HeavySlam attacks by defending, but failed to capitalize on the FireGolem’s Phase 2 transformation into Fire. The BT did not scan the enemy, meaning it didn’t identify the Fire weakness. The MP was used inefficiently, primarily with heals instead of spells. The constant reliance on defending against telegraphed attacks was a reactive strategy, not a proactive one.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1**: Add a task to perform a Scan on turn 1. This would immediately reveal the Fire weakness, allowing for a targeted IceSpell.
2. **Prioritize IceSpell after Scan**: Modify the IceSpell task to *only* execute if the Scan reveals the Fire element. Add a condition: “Enemy Element is Fire”
3. **Defend Only Against HeavySlam**: Revise the Defend() task to *only* activate when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam.  Remove the general "Defend" task. This prevents unnecessary defense against other attacks.
4. **MP Prioritization**:  Adjust the heal threshold.  Instead of healing at 30% HP, trigger the Heal task at 50% HP. This allows for more strategic use of MP for spells.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` - Enemy weak to element (DYNAMIC! Can change during combat)
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
