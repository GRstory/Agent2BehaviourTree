You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- Elemental weakness: Fire ↔ Ice (1.5x damage)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
  - FireGolem: Phase 2 (HP < 50%) permanently becomes Fire element
  - IceWraith: Using IceSpell grants Ice element for 3 turns, then returns to Neutral
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
- FireGolem: FireSpell adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES:
- vs FireGolem: Use IceSpell (15 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Fire element (Phase 2)
- vs IceWraith: Use FireSpell (11 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Ice element (after IceSpell)
- Cleanse value: Removes Burn (30 dmg saved) OR AttackDown (damage restored) + 10% boost
- Wrong spell = damage loss (7 vs 11-15)
- **CRITICAL**: Check enemy element BEFORE using elemental spells!

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they wait for enemy to gain element before using weakness spell?)
- Elemental advantage (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **IceWraith**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Analysis

The BT failed to adequately react to IceWraith’s aggressive use of IceSpell, repeatedly using Attack when it was consistently being damaged by the DoT. The BT didn’t scan, missing the opportunity to reveal IceWraith’s weakness and adapt its strategy. MP was used inefficiently, with multiple heals triggered by critical health, and no proactive scanning. The repeated attacks against IceSpell were a direct result of not recognizing and exploiting the enemy’s DoT.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Scan on Turn 1**: Immediately upon turn 1, execute a Scan action. This would reveal IceWraith's weakness and allow the BT to prioritize IceSpell.

2. **Prioritize IceSpell after Scan**: If the Scan reveals IceWraith is weak to Fire, immediately execute IceSpell on subsequent turns *instead* of Attack. This addresses the core issue of repeatedly taking damage from the DoT.

3. **Conditional Heal Trigger**: Adjust the heal trigger from 50% HP to 40% HP. This would allow for a more proactive heal response, preventing the player from reaching critical health and being vulnerable to IceSpell.  This would also prevent the BT from triggering a heal when the player was already at 50% health and being punished by the DoT.
