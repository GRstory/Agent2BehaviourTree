You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- Elemental weakness: Fire ↔ Ice (1.5x damage)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
  - FireGolem: Phase 2 (HP < 50%) permanently becomes Fire element
  - IceWraith: Using IceSpell grants Ice element for 3 turns, then returns to Neutral
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
- FireGolem: FireSpell adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES:
- vs FireGolem: Use IceSpell (15 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Fire element (Phase 2)
- vs IceWraith: Use FireSpell (11 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Ice element (after IceSpell)
- Cleanse value: Removes Burn (30 dmg saved) OR AttackDown (damage restored) + 10% boost
- Wrong spell = damage loss (7 vs 11-15)
- **CRITICAL**: Check enemy element BEFORE using elemental spells!

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they wait for enemy to gain element before using weakness spell?)
- Elemental advantage (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **FireGolem**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Analysis
The BT consistently relied on defending against HeavySlam, which was predictable and inefficient. The player failed to utilize the scan action to identify the FireGolem’s weakness, leading to repeated ineffective attacks. MP was used somewhat inefficiently, with multiple heals occurring when a more strategic response (like a targeted spell) could have been employed. The BT’s reliance on the “Attack” action as a default was also problematic, especially when a clear weakness existed.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize Scanning:** Immediately after turn 1, add a task to “Scan” the enemy. This should be the *first* action taken on each turn, regardless of other conditions. This addresses the critical failure to identify the FireGolem's weakness.

2. **FireSpell on Scan:**  Add a condition: “HasScannedEnemy() AND EnemyWeakTo(Fire)” to the “FireSpell” task. This ensures the player *always* uses the FireSpell when the enemy is vulnerable.

3. **Defend Only Against HeavySlam:** Modify the “Defend” task to *only* execute when the enemy telegraphs “HeavySlam”. Remove the generic “Defend” task entirely. This prevents unnecessary defense and allows for more strategic action.

4. **MP Efficiency - Prioritize FireSpell:**  Re-evaluate the MP cost of the FireSpell. If the damage output is sufficient, consider reducing the MP cost to encourage its use. (This is a secondary adjustment).
