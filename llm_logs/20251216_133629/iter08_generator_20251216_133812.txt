SYSTEM PROMPT

You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis

The combat against IceWraith highlighted several key issues with the BT’s strategy. Primarily, the BT failed to react effectively to IceWraith’s telegraphs, particularly the FrostBlast. The BT’s reliance on Heal when HP was low proved disastrous, as IceWraith’s FrostBlast consistently topped up its health. The BT also didn’t scan for elemental weaknesses, leading to inefficient spell usage. Finally, the Heal trigger was too low, resulting in missed opportunities to capitalize on IceWraith's vulnerabilities.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Telegraph Reaction - Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs FrostBlast:**  Immediately upon detecting the FrostBlast telegraph (22 dmg), the BT should execute the Defend() action. This would have significantly reduced the damage taken and bought valuable time.

2. **Scan on Turn 1:**  The BT should automatically initiate a scan for elemental weaknesses on turn 1. This would immediately reveal IceWraith’s vulnerability, allowing for the strategic use of IceSpell.

3. **Increase Heal Trigger to 40% HP:** Modify the Heal trigger from 30% to 40% HP. This would allow for more proactive healing when IceWraith was actively dealing damage, rather than waiting until the player was critically low on health.

4. **Prioritize IceSpell when Ice element is active:** Add a condition to the IceSpell task that checks if the enemy has the Ice element. If so, execute the IceSpell. This ensures the most effective spell is always used when available.

5. **Add a "Scan" action that runs on turn 1:**  This would automatically determine the enemy's element and update the BT's state. This would be a one-time action, but would set the stage for more efficient spellcasting in future turns.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

**Tasks (ONLY these 7):**
- `Attack()` - Basic attack
- `Charge()` - Charge for next turn 2x damage
- `FireSpell()` - Fire spell
- `IceSpell()` - Ice spell
- `Defend()` - Reduce damage 50%
- `Heal()` - Heal 40 HP
- `Cleanse()` - Remove debuffs

# CRITICAL RULES

3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
