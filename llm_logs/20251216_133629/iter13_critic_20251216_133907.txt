SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction (ONLY blocks damage, NOT status effects like Debuff/Burn!)
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

VICTORY REQUIREMENTS:
- **FireGolem**: 180 HP / 35 turns = **5.1+ DPS minimum**
- **IceWraith**: 200 HP / 35 turns = **5.7+ DPS minimum**
- **Baseline**: Attack alone = 9 dmg/turn (sufficient if no wasted turns)
- **Target**: 5-6+ effective DPS for consistent wins

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- **CHARGE STRATEGY**:
  - Charge gives CHARGED status (visible in combat log as "Ailments: Charged")
  - CHARGED status doubles damage on NEXT turn ONLY
  - **CRITICAL**: Use HasStatus(CHARGED) condition to detect and cash in the buff!
  - **Common mistake**: Using Charge but never following up with attack → wasted MP and damage
  - **Correct pattern**: Charge → (next turn) Attack/Spell with 2x damage
  - **Example waste**: "Turn 5: Charge → Turn 6: Defend" = CHARGED buff wasted!
  - **Math**: Charge (7 dmg) + CHARGED Attack (18 dmg) = 25 dmg / 2 turns = 12.5 DPS ✓
  
- **CLEANSE USAGE**:
  - **ONLY use when HasStatus(Burn) OR HasStatus(AttackDown)**
  - **Common bug**: Cleanse spam without debuffs → 0 damage output
  - **Correct condition**: `HasStatus(Burn)` or `HasStatus(AttackDown)` MUST be checked
  - **Value**: Cleanse removes Burn (saves 30 dmg) or AttackDown (restores 20% damage)
  
- **DEFEND MECHANICS**:
  - Defend reduces damage by 50% (e.g., HeavySlam 45 dmg → 22 dmg)
  - **Defend does NOT prevent status effects** (Debuff, Burn still applied!)
  - **Primary use**: Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam (45 dmg → 22 dmg)
  - **Debuff telegraph**: Defend CAN reduce Debuff turn damage, BUT:
    - You still get AttackDown (-20% damage for 3 turns)
    - **Better strategy**: Attack (deal damage) → next turn Cleanse (remove debuff)
    - Defend = 0 damage dealt, Cleanse costs 25 MP anyway
  
- **ELEMENTAL SYSTEM**:
  - Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
  - Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies may gain Fire or Ice element during battle
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
  - **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **IceWraith Element Change**:
  - Starts as Neutral (no weakness)
  - When IceWraith uses **FrostBlast** → Gains Ice element for 3 turns
  - When Ice element expires → Returns to Neutral
  - **USE FIRESPELL WHEN ENEMY HAS ICE ELEMENT!**
- **FireGolem Element Change**:
  - Phase 1 (HP > 50%): Neutral element
  - **Phase 2 (HP < 50% = 90 HP)**: Automatically gains Fire element (permanent)
  - **CRITICAL TIMING**: Push to 90 HP → Enemy gains Fire → USE ICESPELL!
  - **USE ICESPELL WHEN ENEMY HAS FIRE ELEMENT!**
- FireGolem: FlameStrike adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

ENEMY PATTERNS:

FireGolem (180 HP, Def 5):
- Phase 1 (HP > 50%): Neutral element, uses Slam/HeavySlam
- Phase 2 (HP < 50%): Permanently gains Fire element, uses FlameStrike
- FlameStrike inflicts Burn: 10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total damage
- Lifesteal: 20% in Phase 1, 10% in Phase 2
- Telegraphs HeavySlam (45 dmg before defense)

IceWraith (200 HP, Def 8):
- Starts Neutral, gains Ice element for 3 turns after using FrostBlast
- FrostBlast: 22 dmg, grants Ice element (3 turns)
- Debuff: Inflicts AttackDown (-20% damage for 3 turns)
- DefensiveStance: +25% defense for 1 turn, +20% damage next turn
- High defense makes spells more efficient than basic attacks

COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS TO IDENTIFY:
1. **"Heal spam"** - Using Heal when HP > 60% → wasted turns
2. **"Passive play"** - Too much Defend without telegraphs → low DPS
3. **"MP starvation"** - Not using Attack enough → can't afford spells
4. **"Ignoring telegraphs"** - Not Defending against HeavySlam → taking 45 dmg
5. **"Defend vs Debuff over-reliance"** - Defend reduces damage but better to Attack → Cleanse
6. **"Phase blindness"** - Not adapting when enemy changes element
7. **"Wasted turns"** - Defend when safe, Heal when full → closer to 35-turn limit

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **DPS calculation** (Total damage / Total turns - is it above 5+?)
- **Charge efficiency** (did they cash in CHARGED status? or waste it on Defend/Heal?)
- **Cleanse bugs** (did they spam Cleanse without debuffs?)
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they understand when enemy gains/loses element?)
- **Phase transition** (FireGolem HP < 50% → did they switch to IceSpell?)
- **Elemental advantage** (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
  - Enemy has Ice → Use FireSpell (1.5x damage)
  - Enemy has Fire → Use IceSpell (1.5x damage)
  - Enemy has Neutral → Use Attack (no spell bonus)
- **Wrong spell usage** (IceSpell vs Ice element = 0.5x damage, TERRIBLE!)
- **Turn efficiency** (Count wasted turns - every waste = closer to 35-turn limit)
- **Defend strategy** (HeavySlam = must Defend, Debuff = situational, better to Attack → Cleanse)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Defensive timing (Defend against HeavySlam is critical!)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

RESPONSE

## Analysis
The combat against IceWraith highlighted several key issues with the BT strategy. Primarily, the BT failed to react effectively to the telegraphed FrostBlast attack, resulting in significant damage taken. Secondly, the BT didn't capitalize on the IceWraith's temporary Ice element, failing to use FireSpell when it was most effective. Finally, MP management was poor, with the BT prioritizing spells over more reliable damage output. The lack of scanning at the start of the fight also contributed to the unfavorable outcome.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs FrostBlast**:  Immediately upon seeing the telegraph for FrostBlast (22 dmg), trigger the Defend() task. This would have significantly reduced the damage taken and potentially allowed for a follow-up action.

2. **Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2**:  At the start of the combat, add a task to “Scan Enemy” that checks for the enemy’s current element. If Ice is detected, the BT should immediately prioritize using FireSpell. This would have prevented the wasted turns and maximized damage output.

3. **Adjust MP Prioritization**:  Modify the BT to prioritize Attack over FireSpell when MP is low.  If MP is below 30, trigger the Attack task instead of a spell. This ensures consistent damage output and avoids running out of MP when a spell is needed most.  Specifically, change the FireSpell condition to “HasMP(20) AND EnemyHasElement(Ice)” to only use it when absolutely necessary.

4. **Introduce a “Freeze” Condition**: Add a condition to check if the player is “Frozen”. If so, trigger a Heal task to remove the Freeze status. This addresses the immediate damage taken from FrostBlast.

5. **Increase Heal Threshold**: Change the Heal threshold from 40% to 50%. This ensures that the player is healed more frequently, reducing the risk of being reduced to critical health.
