You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- Elemental weakness: Fire ↔ Ice (1.5x damage)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
  - FireGolem: Phase 2 (HP < 50%) permanently becomes Fire element
  - IceWraith: Using IceSpell grants Ice element for 3 turns, then returns to Neutral
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
- FireGolem: FireSpell adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES:
- vs FireGolem: Use IceSpell (15 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Fire element (Phase 2)
- vs IceWraith: Use FireSpell (11 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Ice element (after IceSpell)
- Cleanse value: Removes Burn (30 dmg saved) OR AttackDown (damage restored) + 10% boost
- Wrong spell = damage loss (7 vs 11-15)
- **CRITICAL**: Check enemy element BEFORE using elemental spells!

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they wait for enemy to gain element before using weakness spell?)
- Elemental advantage (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **IceWraith**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**
## Analysis

## Improvement Suggestions

2. [Logic change description]
3. [Logic change description]

Be concise and actionable.

RESPONSE

## Analysis
The BT struggled to adapt to IceWraith’s aggressive telegraphing of the “Debuff” attack. It consistently attacked without scanning, failing to identify the weakness and utilize the IceSpell effectively. The MP was also used inefficiently, with multiple heals used when a more strategic approach (like scanning for a weakness) could have been more beneficial. The BT didn’t prioritize the most impactful actions, leading to a prolonged fight and ultimately, a lower final HP.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1**: Immediately after the start, the BT *must* execute a Scan. This guarantees the player identifies the weakness (Debuff) and can prepare accordingly. This addresses the core issue of not reacting to the telegraph.

2. **Prioritize IceSpell after Scan**:  If the Scan reveals the Debuff, the BT should *immediately* execute IceSpell. This should be the highest priority action on turn 2.

3. **Adjust Heal Threshold**: Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 80% to 70%. This would encourage the BT to prioritize more strategic actions (like scanning or using the IceSpell) over simply healing low HP, which was a frequent occurrence.  The BT was too reactive and didn't proactively manage its resources.
