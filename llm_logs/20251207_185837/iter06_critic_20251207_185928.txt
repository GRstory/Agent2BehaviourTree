SYSTEM PROMPT

You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice. Despite scanning and confirming the weakness, the BT repeatedly used the default `Attack` task, which is ineffective against a fire enemy.  The Heal task was triggered too late, only when the player's HP was already critically low. The Defend task was triggered by a telegraph, but the attack was still happening, rendering it useless. MP was consumed aggressively with the IceSpell, but the attack was still the primary action. The lack of adaptation to the enemy's telegraphs is a key problem.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize IceSpell on Weakness Confirmation:**  Modify the `IceSpell()` task to execute immediately upon confirming the FireGolem’s Ice weakness.  Remove the MP check – the IceSpell should be prioritized regardless of MP availability.
2.  **Heal Trigger Adjustment:** Change the Heal trigger to HP below 50% instead of 70%. This allows for a more proactive healing strategy, preventing the player from reaching a critical state.
3.  **Defend Trigger Enhancement:**  Adjust the Defend task’s trigger to be activated *before* the Attack task. This allows the player to prepare for the attack, potentially mitigating damage.
4. **Introduce a "Scan Repeat" Task:** Add a task that repeats the Scan action every 3 turns to ensure the weakness is continually monitored. This addresses the issue of the weakness being missed.
