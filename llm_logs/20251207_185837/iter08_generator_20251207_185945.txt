SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently attempts to use Ice spells against the FireGolem, despite the enemy's inherent weakness to Ice. This is a fundamental flaw in the strategy. The BT doesn't adapt to the enemy's type, sticking rigidly to a pre-determined spell selection based on scanning. The Heal task is triggered too late, only when the player's HP is critically low. The Defend task is present but never utilized, representing a missed opportunity for proactive defense. The lack of defensive action combined with the inflexible spell selection led to a quick and overwhelming defeat.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Elemental Advantage:** Modify the BT to always select the *most* effective spell based on enemy weakness *after* a successful scan.  Instead of a hard-coded sequence, implement a function that evaluates all available spells based on the enemy's weaknesses.
2.  **Early Defensive Trigger:** Adjust the ‘IsPlayerHPLow’ condition to a lower threshold (e.g., 60%) to initiate the Heal task sooner, preventing the player from reaching critical health.
3.  **Introduce a Defend Task:** Add a Defend task to the main sequence.  This should be triggered *before* spellcasting, providing a consistent defensive layer regardless of the enemy type. Consider a priority system where Defend takes precedence over spellcasting if the enemy is weak to it.
4.  **Adaptive Scan Priority:**  If the scan returns multiple weaknesses, prioritize the most damaging one for spell selection.  For example, if both Ice and Lightning are weaknesses, prioritize Lightning as it likely deals more damage.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
