You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice, despite scanning. The MP expenditure on IceSpell was too infrequent, and the Heal task was triggered too late, leaving the player vulnerable. The reliance on basic Attack without adaptation to the enemy’s telegraphing or potential weaknesses led to predictable damage output. The BT's current structure doesn’t prioritize proactive adaptation, relying on reactive triggers.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1:**  Implement a rule that the Scan() task *must* be executed on turn 1. This ensures the BT always attempts to identify the enemy's weakness.
2.  **IceSpell Priority:**  Adjust the IceSpell task's priority.  If Scan() returns Ice as the weakness, IceSpell should be executed *before* the basic Attack.  This should be a higher priority task than Attack.
3.  **Heal Threshold Increase:** Increase the Heal trigger threshold from 60% to 70%.  Waiting until HP is only at 60% is too late to meaningfully impact the fight.
4.  **Adaptive Attack Delay:** Introduce a small delay (e.g., 1 turn) after an Attack, before executing the next task. This allows for observation of the enemy's reaction and potential telegraphing, informing subsequent decisions.
5.  **Conditional Scan Reset:**  Add a condition to the Scan task that resets the scan result on each turn. This prevents the BT from clinging to an outdated weakness assessment.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
