SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

Generate an IMPROVED Behaviour Tree based on feedback.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Heal when critical
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(20)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()
        
        # Default: Attack
        task : Attack()

```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The player consistently failed to exploit the FireGolem’s vulnerability to Water damage. The current BT defaults to attacking, regardless of elemental advantage. The lack of a scan action means the player never identified the FireGolem’s weakness.  The Heal task is triggered immediately when HP is low, but doesn't consider the enemy's elemental type.  The BT’s reliance on a low HP threshold for healing is a reactive strategy that doesn’t proactively counter the enemy’s attacks. The 6-turn duration suggests a slow, unfocused battle, likely due to the lack of a defined strategy.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement a Scan Action:** Add a scan action to the BT. This action should be triggered on turn 1 and check the enemy's elemental type. If the enemy is Fire, the BT should prioritize Water spells.
2.  **Conditional Heal Task:** Modify the Heal task. Instead of triggering on low HP, it should only activate if the enemy is Fire *and* the player’s HP is below 60%. This ensures the heal is used strategically against the enemy’s weakness.
3.  **Introduce a Defensive Action:** Add a ‘Defend’ task to the BT. This task should be triggered if the enemy is attacking, providing a brief window to mitigate damage before the player can cast a spell.  This would prevent the player from taking excessive damage before a counter-attack.
4.  **Prioritize Spell Selection:** Modify the attack task to always choose a Water spell when the FireGolem is scanned. This ensures the player is always using their strongest attack against the enemy's weakness.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
