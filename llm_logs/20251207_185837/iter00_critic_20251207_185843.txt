SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The player consistently failed to exploit the FireGolem’s vulnerability to Water damage. The current BT defaults to attacking, regardless of elemental advantage. The lack of a scan action means the player never identified the FireGolem’s weakness.  The Heal task is triggered immediately when HP is low, but doesn't consider the enemy's elemental type.  The BT’s reliance on a low HP threshold for healing is a reactive strategy that doesn’t proactively counter the enemy’s attacks. The 6-turn duration suggests a slow, unfocused battle, likely due to the lack of a defined strategy.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement a Scan Action:** Add a scan action to the BT. This action should be triggered on turn 1 and check the enemy's elemental type. If the enemy is Fire, the BT should prioritize Water spells.
2.  **Conditional Heal Task:** Modify the Heal task. Instead of triggering on low HP, it should only activate if the enemy is Fire *and* the player’s HP is below 60%. This ensures the heal is used strategically against the enemy’s weakness.
3.  **Introduce a Defensive Action:** Add a ‘Defend’ task to the BT. This task should be triggered if the enemy is attacking, providing a brief window to mitigate damage before the player can cast a spell.  This would prevent the player from taking excessive damage before a counter-attack.
4.  **Prioritize Spell Selection:** Modify the attack task to always choose a Water spell when the FireGolem is scanned. This ensures the player is always using their strongest attack against the enemy's weakness.
