You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The consistent defeats against the FireGolem highlight a critical failure in adapting to the enemy's element and a reactive defensive strategy. The BT relies heavily on scanning and then immediately using Ice, which is ineffective against a Fire enemy. The Heal task is triggered too late, only when HP is critically low, and the Defend task is triggered by a telegraph, meaning the player was already taking damage. The BT’s current structure is too rigid and doesn’t prioritize proactive elemental exploitation or anticipate the enemy's attacks. The lack of any offensive strategy beyond the Ice spell is a major contributor to the losses.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Elemental Adaptation:**  Modify the BT to *always* scan for enemy weaknesses on turn 1.  If a weakness is found (Ice in this case), immediately execute the IceSpell task.  This eliminates the delay and potential for the enemy to heal.

2.  **Dynamic Defend Trigger:** Change the Defend task trigger. Instead of ‘IsTurnEarly(3)’ and telegraphing, make Defend a constant task, always active. This allows the player to consistently mitigate damage, regardless of turn number or enemy telegraphs.

3.  **Heal Threshold Adjustment:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal task from 50% to 75%. This allows the player to proactively heal before reaching a critically low HP level, improving survivability and potentially allowing for more offensive actions.

4.  **Introduce a Reactive Attack:** Add a simple "Attack" task that runs *after* the Scan task, but *before* the IceSpell task, if no weakness is found. This ensures the player is always attempting to deal damage, even if the initial scan doesn’t reveal a weakness.  This prevents the player from simply standing still and waiting for the Ice spell to be triggered.
