You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The BT consistently prioritized using IceSpell when the FireGolem was scanned and weak to Ice, but failed to adapt to the FireGolem’s relentless attacks. The MP expenditure on IceSpell was too frequent and didn’t translate into sufficient damage reduction or control. The BT’s defensive actions were triggered by telegraphing HeavySlam, which the FireGolem rarely used, leading to wasted defensive actions. The Heal task was triggered too late, by the time the player was at 50% HP, the FireGolem was already at max HP. The overall strategy was reactive rather than proactive, failing to capitalize on the identified weakness.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Damage Reduction:** Modify the ‘IceSpell’ task to have a higher priority than ‘Attack’.  The IceSpell should be used more aggressively when the FireGolem is scanned and weak to Ice, aiming for a damage output that can at least mitigate a significant portion of the FireGolem’s attacks.
2.  **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for the ‘Heal’ task from 50% to 60%. This will allow the player to heal sooner, potentially preventing critical damage.
3.  **Introduce a “Counter-Attack” Task:** Add a task triggered when the FireGolem is telegraphing a HeavySlam. This task should execute a basic attack, potentially disrupting the enemy’s rhythm. This will force the FireGolem to react and potentially reveal other attack patterns.
4. **Adaptive Scanning:** Modify the scanning behavior to be more responsive to enemy actions. Instead of fixed turn intervals, add a condition that triggers a scan after the FireGolem attacks, maximizing the chance of scanning when the enemy is actively engaging.
