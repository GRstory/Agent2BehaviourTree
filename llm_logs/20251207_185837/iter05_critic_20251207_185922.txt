SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice, despite scanning. The MP expenditure on IceSpell was too infrequent, and the Heal task was triggered too late, leaving the player vulnerable. The reliance on basic Attack without adaptation to the enemy’s telegraphing or potential weaknesses led to predictable damage output. The BT's current structure doesn’t prioritize proactive adaptation, relying on reactive triggers.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1:**  Implement a rule that the Scan() task *must* be executed on turn 1. This ensures the BT always attempts to identify the enemy's weakness.
2.  **IceSpell Priority:**  Adjust the IceSpell task's priority.  If Scan() returns Ice as the weakness, IceSpell should be executed *before* the basic Attack.  This should be a higher priority task than Attack.
3.  **Heal Threshold Increase:** Increase the Heal trigger threshold from 60% to 70%.  Waiting until HP is only at 60% is too late to meaningfully impact the fight.
4.  **Adaptive Attack Delay:** Introduce a small delay (e.g., 1 turn) after an Attack, before executing the next task. This allows for observation of the enemy's reaction and potential telegraphing, informing subsequent decisions.
5.  **Conditional Scan Reset:**  Add a condition to the Scan task that resets the scan result on each turn. This prevents the BT from clinging to an outdated weakness assessment.
