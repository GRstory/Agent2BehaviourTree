SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Defend against FrostBlast
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

        # Exploit Fire weakness
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : IceSpell()

        # Exploit Ice weakness
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : FireSpell()

            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT failed to effectively counter IceWraith's initial aggression and didn't capitalize on the Ice element vulnerability. The BT relied solely on a generic "Attack" action, failing to recognize the FrostBlast telegraph and the opportunity to use FireSpell. The MP was also not managed effectively, with the player not scanning for the Ice element. The final outcome was a swift defeat with minimal damage dealt.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Add Scan on Turn 1**:  Add a task to "Scan" on turn 1. This task would check the enemy's current element. If Ice is detected, immediately execute "FireSpell". This addresses the critical failure of not utilizing the Ice element weakness.

2. **Modify Attack Action - Add Defend on FrostBlast**: Add a condition to the "Attack" action: "If enemy is telegraphing FrostBlast, execute Defend()". This ensures the player defends against the most dangerous attack.

3. **Adjust Attack MP Cost**: Reduce the MP cost of the "Attack" action from 10 to 7. This will allow the player to afford more spells and scans, increasing their responsiveness.

4. **Introduce a Priority System**: Add a priority system to the BT. If the enemy is telegraphing FrostBlast, priority 1: Defend. If the enemy is telegraphing FrostBlast and has Ice element, priority 2: FireSpell. This ensures the most critical actions are executed first.

5. **Increase Scan Frequency**:  Change the Scan action to occur every turn instead of just turn 1. This ensures the player is always aware of the enemy's element and can react accordingly.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x when enemy has Ice element
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x when enemy has Fire element
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
