SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Defend against telegraphs
        sequence :
            selector :
                condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
                condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(FlameStrike)
                condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(Debuff)
                condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(FrostTouch)
            task : Defend()

        # Heal when HP is low
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(60)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

            task : FireSpell()

        # Low MP defense
        sequence :
            condition : HasMP(30)
            NOT : HasMP(30)
            task : Defend()

        # Default: Attack
        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT failed to adequately respond to IceWraith’s telegraphing of FrostTouch attacks and consistently used the wrong spell when the enemy had the Ice element. The MP was also used inefficiently, with several Heal actions taken when they could have been avoided. The BT didn’t prioritize scanning for enemy element changes, leading to repeated ineffective spellcasting.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Implement Telegraph Defense:** Add a condition to the `selector` to check if the enemy is telegraphing FrostTouch. If true, execute the `Defend()` task *before* the attack. This is crucial given the frequent use of FrostTouch.

2. **Mandatory Element Scan:** Add a task at the beginning of each turn (turn 1) to scan the enemy for their current element. If the enemy is Ice, prioritize using FireSpell. This prevents the repeated use of FireSpell when Ice was active.

3. **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 60% to 70%. This would allow the BT to trigger the Heal action more frequently, potentially mitigating damage more effectively.

4. **Prioritize FireSpell on Ice:** Add a higher priority to the FireSpell task when the enemy has the Ice element. This should be a direct consequence of the element scan.  The current logic allows for a FireSpell to be used even when the enemy has Ice, which is a major strategic error.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x when enemy has Ice element
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x when enemy has Fire element
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
