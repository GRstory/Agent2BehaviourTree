SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Heal when critical
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(40)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # Exploit Fire weakness

            condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
            condition : HasMP(20)

        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to react effectively to IceWraith's telegraphing of FrostBlast and relied heavily on the FireSpell even when the enemy was already afflicted with Ice. The MP usage was inefficient, with several FireSpells used when a more strategic approach (like using IceSpell) would have been more effective. The BT didn’t prioritize defensive actions when telegraphed attacks were imminent.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Telegraph Reaction - Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs FrostBlast:**  "Add a condition to the BT to execute Defend() when the enemy initiates FrostBlast. This would mitigate the damage from the telegraphed attack."

2. **Elemental Scanning - Add Scan on Turn 1:** "Add a task on turn 1 to scan the enemy. This task would determine the enemy's element and automatically select the appropriate spell (IceSpell when Ice detected, FireSpell when Fire detected, Attack when Neutral)."

3. **Strategic Spell Selection - Prioritize IceSpell when Ice Detected:** "Modify the IceSpell task to execute *before* the FireSpell task when the enemy's element is Ice. This ensures the 1.5x damage bonus is always applied."

4. **Defensive Prioritization - Add Defend() after FrostBlast:** “Add a condition to the BT to execute Defend() immediately after the enemy uses FrostBlast. This will provide a crucial defense against the initial damage.”


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x when enemy has Ice element
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x when enemy has Fire element
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
