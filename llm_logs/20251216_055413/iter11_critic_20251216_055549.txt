You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- **ELEMENTAL SYSTEM**:
  - Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
  - Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies may gain Fire or Ice element during battle
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
  - **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **IceWraith Element Change**:
  - Starts as Neutral (no weakness)
  - When IceWraith uses **FrostBlast** → Gains Ice element for 3 turns
  - When Ice element expires → Returns to Neutral
  - **USE FIRESPELL WHEN ENEMY HAS ICE ELEMENT!**
- **FireGolem Element Change**:
  - Phase 1 (HP > 50%): Neutral element
  - Phase 2 (HP < 50%): Automatically gains Fire element (permanent)
  - **USE ICESPELL WHEN ENEMY HAS FIRE ELEMENT!**
- FireGolem: FlameStrike adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

ENEMY PATTERNS:

FireGolem (180 HP, Def 5):
- Phase 1 (HP > 50%): Neutral element, uses Slam/HeavySlam
- Phase 2 (HP < 50%): Permanently gains Fire element, uses FlameStrike
- FlameStrike inflicts Burn: 10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total damage
- Lifesteal: 20% in Phase 1, 10% in Phase 2
- Telegraphs HeavySlam (45 dmg before defense)

IceWraith (200 HP, Def 8):
- Starts Neutral, gains Ice element for 3 turns after using FrostBlast
- FrostBlast: 22 dmg, grants Ice element (3 turns)
- Debuff: Inflicts AttackDown (-20% damage for 3 turns)
- DefensiveStance: +25% defense for 1 turn, +20% damage next turn
- High defense makes spells more efficient than basic attacks

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they understand when enemy gains/loses element?)
- **Elemental advantage** (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
  - Enemy has Ice → Use FireSpell (1.5x damage)
  - Enemy has Fire → Use IceSpell (1.5x damage)
  - Enemy has Neutral → Use Attack (no spell bonus)
- **Wrong spell usage** (IceSpell vs Ice element = 0.5x damage, TERRIBLE!)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **FireGolem**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis

The BT struggled to consistently react to the FireGolem’s telegraphed HeavySlam attacks and failed to capitalize on its Fire element. The reliance on IceSpell when the enemy was already Fire was a critical error, resulting in minimal damage. MP was often wasted, and defensive decisions were inconsistent. The BT didn’t effectively utilize the ‘scan’ functionality to identify the enemy’s element.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Telegraph Defense:** Add a Defend() task to the BT when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam. This should be triggered immediately upon seeing the telegraph. This addresses the missed defensive opportunities.

2. **Scan on Turn 1:** Modify the BT to automatically scan the enemy on turn 1 to determine its element. If the enemy is Fire, immediately execute IceSpell. This eliminates the wasted MP and incorrect spell usage.

3. **Dynamic Element Prioritization:**  Revise the BT’s element handling. Instead of simply executing IceSpell when the enemy has Ice, prioritize IceSpell when the enemy has Fire. This creates a more reactive and strategic approach to elemental advantage.  Also, add a condition to *always* execute IceSpell when the enemy has Fire.

4. **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for Heal from 30% to 40%. This will allow the player to heal more frequently, especially when the enemy is consistently dealing damage with FlameStrike.

5. **MP Prioritization:**  If the player is at low MP, prioritize using Heal over IceSpell.  A new condition could be added: "If MP < 30, prioritize Heal over IceSpell".
