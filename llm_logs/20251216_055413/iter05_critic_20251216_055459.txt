You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- **ELEMENTAL SYSTEM**:
  - Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
  - Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies may gain Fire or Ice element during battle
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
  - **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **IceWraith Element Change**:
  - Starts as Neutral (no weakness)
  - When IceWraith uses **FrostBlast** → Gains Ice element for 3 turns
  - When Ice element expires → Returns to Neutral
  - **USE FIRESPELL WHEN ENEMY HAS ICE ELEMENT!**
- **FireGolem Element Change**:
  - Phase 1 (HP > 50%): Neutral element
  - Phase 2 (HP < 50%): Automatically gains Fire element (permanent)
  - **USE ICESPELL WHEN ENEMY HAS FIRE ELEMENT!**
- FireGolem: FlameStrike adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

ENEMY PATTERNS:

FireGolem (180 HP, Def 5):
- Phase 1 (HP > 50%): Neutral element, uses Slam/HeavySlam
- Phase 2 (HP < 50%): Permanently gains Fire element, uses FlameStrike
- FlameStrike inflicts Burn: 10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total damage
- Lifesteal: 20% in Phase 1, 10% in Phase 2
- Telegraphs HeavySlam (45 dmg before defense)

IceWraith (200 HP, Def 8):
- Starts Neutral, gains Ice element for 3 turns after using FrostBlast
- FrostBlast: 22 dmg, grants Ice element (3 turns)
- Debuff: Inflicts AttackDown (-20% damage for 3 turns)
- DefensiveStance: +25% defense for 1 turn, +20% damage next turn
- High defense makes spells more efficient than basic attacks

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they understand when enemy gains/loses element?)
- **Elemental advantage** (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
  - Enemy has Ice → Use FireSpell (1.5x damage)
  - Enemy has Fire → Use IceSpell (1.5x damage)
  - Enemy has Neutral → Use Attack (no spell bonus)
- **Wrong spell usage** (IceSpell vs Ice element = 0.5x damage, TERRIBLE!)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **FireGolem**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Analysis
The BT struggled to consistently react to the FireGolem's telegraphed attacks, often opting for a default attack instead of a defensive action. The most significant issue was a failure to recognize and exploit the FireGolem's evolving element. Initially, the BT attempted IceSpell when the enemy was Fire, but this was abandoned when the enemy gained Fire.  MP usage was inefficient, with several attacks used when a more strategic option (like a heal) would have been beneficial. Finally, the BT didn’t consistently prioritize defensive actions when the enemy was telegraphing a powerful attack.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement Telegraph Defense:** Add a Defend() task to the BT when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam *or* FlameStrike. This should be the highest priority action in these situations.
2.  **Scan on Turn 1:** Add a "Scan" task to the BT that runs on turn 1. This task should immediately identify the enemy's element and update the BT's state.  This prevents the BT from repeatedly using IceSpell when the enemy is Fire.
3.  **Prioritize Healing:** Modify the "Heal" task to have a lower MP cost (e.g., 20 MP) and increase the HP healing threshold to 40% or 50%. This would allow for more frequent healing opportunities, especially when the player’s HP is low.
4.  **Elemental Awareness Trigger:** Add a condition to the IceSpell task that checks if the enemy is currently Fire. If true, execute IceSpell. If false, execute Attack. This ensures the BT always uses the most effective spell given the enemy's current element.
