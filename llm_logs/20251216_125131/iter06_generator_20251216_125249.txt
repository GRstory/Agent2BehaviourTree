SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The combat highlights several key issues with the BT’s current strategy. Primarily, the BT failed to consistently react to the FireGolem’s telegraphed HeavySlam attacks, leading to significant damage taken. Secondly, the BT didn't effectively utilize the FireGolem’s permanent Fire element, failing to capitalize on the IceSpell’s 1.5x damage bonus. Finally, MP management was poor, with the BT frequently using spells when it could have used attacks for more efficient MP recovery. The lack of scanning also contributed to the failure to recognize the FireGolem’s permanent element.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize Telegraphed Defense:** Add a conditional task to the BT: “Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam”. This should be the *highest priority* task when the HeavySlam telegraph is detected. This directly addresses the most damaging attacks.

2. **Implement Scanning on Turn 1:** Modify the BT to automatically scan the enemy on turn 1. This will immediately reveal the Fire element, allowing for the correct IceSpell strategy.  This eliminates the delay and potential for wasted turns.

3. **Adjust MP Management:**  Modify the BT to prioritize attacks over spells when MP is low. Specifically, change the “Attack()” task to be the *default* action when MP is below 40%.  Add a conditional task: “Attack()” when MP < 40% and no other task is active.  This ensures the BT doesn't waste MP on spells when a basic attack would be more effective.

4. **Increase Heal Threshold:** Modify the BT to use Heal when HP falls below 40%, instead of 30%. This provides a more proactive approach to HP management and reduces the risk of being caught with extremely low health.

5. **Add a 'Status Check' Task:** Add a task that checks for the Fire element *before* casting any spells. If the enemy angiography is Fire, the BT should immediately cast the IceSpell. This ensures the correct spell is always used.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)

    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
