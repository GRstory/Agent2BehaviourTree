You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The player consistently engaged in melee attacks against the FireGolem, failing to exploit its fire weakness. The BT only executes the default "Attack" task, regardless of enemy telegraphs or elemental vulnerabilities. The player’s reliance on the default attack led to significant damage taken, especially during the enemy’s repeated HeavySlam telegraphs. The lack of defensive actions (Defend, Heal) further exacerbated the situation. The player’s MP usage was also somewhat inefficient, with a large heal used early, leaving little MP for more strategic actions.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement Telegraph Reaction:** Add a “Defend” task to the BT that is triggered when the enemy telegraphs “HeavySlam”. This should execute immediately after the telegraph.
2.  **Elemental Scan on Turn 1:** Modify the BT to initiate a “Scan” task on turn 1. The scan should identify the enemy’s element (Fire) and update the BT’s state.
3.  **Conditional Healing:** Modify the “Heal” task to have a higher HP healing threshold (e.g., 40% instead of 20%) to allow for more frequent healing, especially after taking significant damage.  Also, add a condition to heal *only* if the player's HP is below 30%.
4.  **Prioritize Elemental Damage:**  Adjust the “Attack” task to prioritize spells that deal Fire damage when the enemy’s element is confirmed to be Fire.  This could be a simple weighting system based on the scan result.
