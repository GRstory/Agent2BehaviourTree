You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The player consistently defaulted to attacking and exploiting elemental weaknesses without proper scanning. The FireGolem’s immunity to fire was not detected, leading to a prolonged, ineffective exchange. The reliance on ‘IsTurnEarly’ for scanning is too rigid and misses opportunities. The Heal task was triggered too late, and the ‘IsPlayerHPLow’ conditions were not aggressive enough to prevent the player from being overwhelmed. The BT prioritizes spellcasting based on weak spot scans, but doesn’t account for the enemy’s potential to adapt or counter.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1:** Add a task at the root of the tree that *always* executes a ‘Scan’ on turn 1. This ensures the enemy’s weaknesses are identified immediately.
2. **Aggressive Heal Threshold:** Adjust the ‘IsPlayerHPLow’ condition to trigger a ‘Heal’ at 30% HP, rather than 50%. This allows for more proactive healing and prevents the player from dropping to critical health.
3. **Prioritize Scan after Attack:** Modify the ‘Scan’ task to execute *after* an attack. This creates a feedback loop: attack, scan, then react based on the scan results. This addresses the issue of not scanning until a turn is almost over.
4. **Conditional Scan Prioritization:**  Introduce a new condition: “EnemyWeakTo(Fire)” at the root. If the enemy is weak to fire, immediately execute the ‘FireSpell’ task. This overrides the ‘IsTurnEarly’ scan for fire weaknesses.
5. **Dynamic Defend:**  Replace the ‘IsPlayerHPLow(60)’ condition with a more responsive ‘IsPlayerHPLow(40)’ to trigger the ‘Defend’ task more frequently, providing a defensive layer against the FireGolem's attacks.
