You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

3. [Logic change description]

Be concise and actionable.

## Analysis
The combat repeatedly ended with the player at 0 HP against the FireGolem, despite the enemy's weakness to Ice being identified through scanning. The BT is overly reliant on immediate spellcasting after scanning and doesn’t adapt well to the enemy’s telegraphing behavior. The aggressive heal is frequently triggered, consuming TP unnecessarily when the enemy is consistently telegraphing attacks. The BT prioritizes immediate Ice/Fire spells over defensive positioning, leading to predictable damage output and failure to capitalize on the enemy’s vulnerabilities. The lack of adaptation to the enemy’s HeavySlam telegraph is a critical flaw.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Introduce a Defensive Layer:** Add a “Defend” task *before* any scanning or spellcasting. This should be triggered by any HeavySlam telegraph, ensuring the player is always prepared for the most common attack. This should be a priority task.

2. **Scan Delay & Telegraph Adaptation:** Modify the Ice and Fire exploit sequences. Instead of immediately triggering the scan after a successful scan, introduce a delay (e.g., 2 turns) *after* the scan. During this delay, continuously monitor for HeavySlam telegraphs. If a telegraph is detected, immediately execute the “Defend” task. This allows the player to react to the telegraph and potentially interrupt the attack.

3. **Heal Threshold Adjustment:** Increase the heal threshold from 60% to 70%. The frequent triggering of the aggressive heal is draining TP without significantly impacting the battle's outcome. A higher threshold allows for more strategic healing.

4. **Prioritize Scan on Turn 1:** Shift the Scan task to be executed on turn 1 instead of turn 3. This provides the initial information needed to exploit the enemy's weakness.

5. **Introduce a "Wait" Task:** Add a "Wait" task after the initial scan. This would allow the BT to evaluate the situation for 1-2 turns before deciding on the next action, preventing impulsive spellcasting.
