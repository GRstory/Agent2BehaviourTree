You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

Be concise and actionable.

## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem’s vulnerability to Ice, despite scanning it. The aggressive heal and power strike sequences were triggered too late, and the TP/MP usage was inefficient. The BT prioritized scanning when enemy HP was high, but didn’t consistently execute the IceSpell when the enemy was scanned and vulnerable. The reliance on the "Emergency Defend" sequence was also a reactive measure that didn’t prevent the damage. The overall strategy felt disjointed, failing to build on the information gained through scanning.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize IceSpell on Scan:** Modify the "Fire Exploit" sequence to execute the IceSpell immediately upon scanning the enemy and confirming vulnerability.  This should be the highest priority when the enemy is scanned and weak to Ice.
2. **Dynamic Heal Threshold:** Adjust the “Aggressive Heal” trigger from 20% to 30% HP.  This will allow for more proactive healing, particularly if the FireGolem’s attacks are predictable.
3. **TP Cost Reduction for IceSpell:** Reduce the MP cost of the IceSpell to 10. This will allow for more frequent use of the IceSpell, increasing the chance of exploiting the weakness.
4. **Scan on Turn 1:** Scan the enemy on turn 1 instead of waiting for turn 2. This ensures the vulnerability to Ice is identified as quickly as possible.
