SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree

        sequence :
            condition : IsTurnEarly(1)

```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The combat consistently resulted in defeat against the FireGolem, primarily due to a rigid and inflexible BT. The BT relies heavily on scanning and exploiting weaknesses, but fails to adapt when the initial assumptions are incorrect. The FireGolem was consistently resistant to Ice, leading to wasted MP on Ice spells. The BT doesn’t have a mechanism to re-evaluate the situation after a failed scan or spell. The Heal task is triggered too late, and the Defend task is triggered by a telegraph that never materialized. The reliance on scanning before every spell cast is inefficient.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Introduce a "Re-Scan" Task:** After each spell cast (regardless of success), add a task that checks if the enemy's weakness has changed. If the enemy is no longer weak to the current element, initiate a scan. This prevents wasted MP on ineffective spells.

2.  **Adjust Heal Trigger:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal task from 50% to 70%. This will allow the Heal to be triggered earlier, potentially saving the player from critical damage.

3.  **Introduce a "Delay Defend" Task:** Add a delay after the "IsEnemyTelegraphing" condition. This delay (e.g., 1-2 turns) allows the BT to observe if the HeavySlam telegraph actually occurs. If it doesn’t, the Defend task is skipped. This prevents unnecessary MP expenditure.

4. **Implement a Priority System for Spell Selection:** Instead of always attempting the most obvious weakness exploit, introduce a priority system based on MP cost and the probability of success. For example, if the Ice spell is consistently failing, prioritize a less expensive attack spell.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
