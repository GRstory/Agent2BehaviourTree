You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

3. [Logic change description]

Be concise and actionable.

## Analysis
The combat repeatedly failed to capitalize on the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice. The BT consistently defaulted to a ‘wait and attack’ strategy, even after scanning revealed the weakness. The ‘Defend’ task was triggered unnecessarily frequently due to the ‘Telegraph’ condition, disrupting the planned Ice spell execution. Resource management was inefficient, with TP and MP remaining unused during critical moments. The aggressive heal was triggered too late, and the ‘Power Strike’ was triggered when the enemy was already at full health. The BT lacked a robust mechanism to prioritize actions based on the scan results and enemy weaknesses.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize Scan Results:** Modify the root node to always execute the scan task on turn 1.  This ensures the enemy's weaknesses are identified immediately.
2. **Conditional Defend:**  Remove the 'Telegraph' condition from the 'Defend' task in the Ice exploit sequence. Only trigger 'Defend' if the scan reveals the weakness *and* the enemy is not telegraphing. This prevents unnecessary defense.
3. **Adaptive Spell Selection:** Implement a mechanism to automatically select the appropriate spell based on the scan result.  If the scan identifies a weakness, the 'IceSpell' should be prioritized over 'FireSpell' and 'LightningSpell'.  This could be a simple ‘if’ statement within the root node or a more complex selector.
4. **Heal Threshold Adjustment:** Increase the heal threshold from 70% to 60%. This allows the player to heal earlier, potentially mitigating damage and allowing for more strategic spellcasting.
5. **Introduce a "Delay" Task:** Add a "Delay" task after the scan. This gives the BT a brief pause (1-2 turns) to fully process the scan results before executing any other action, allowing for more informed decision-making.
