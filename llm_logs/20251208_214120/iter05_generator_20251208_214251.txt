You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently prioritized exploiting the FireGolem's weakness to Ice, despite the FireGolem being the enemy. This happened every turn. The BT never adapted to the enemy's high HP and resistance to Ice damage. The Heal action was never triggered, despite the player reaching critical health. The Defend action was triggered sporadically, but without a clear pattern or trigger that aligns with the enemy's actions. The MP usage was relatively high, focused on Ice and Fire spells, but not optimized for maximum damage output. The lack of a default attack when no other high-priority actions were available is a significant issue, leading to wasted turns.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Adaptive Scanning:** Modify the scan behavior. Instead of scanning on turn 1, implement a scan on turn 1 *and* a scan every 3 turns. This ensures the player is continuously assessing enemy weaknesses, rather than relying on a single initial scan.

2.  **Prioritize Damage:** Re-evaluate the priority of the IceSpell and FireSpell. If the FireGolem is consistently resistant to Ice, reduce the priority of the IceSpell.  Introduce a condition to check the enemy's resistance to Ice *before* executing the IceSpell. If resistance is high, immediately move to the default attack.

3.  **Dynamic Heal Threshold:** Adjust the heal trigger. Instead of a fixed HP threshold of 50, implement a dynamic heal trigger based on the *percentage* of maximum HP lost. For example, trigger Heal when PlayerHP is below 60%. This will allow for more responsive healing.

4.  **Defend on Telegraphed Attacks:**  Increase the trigger for Defend.  Instead of "EnemyIsTelegraphing(Any)", implement a condition that requires the enemy to perform a specific attack action (e.g., a charged attack) *before* triggering Defend. This makes the Defend action more strategic.

5.  **Introduce a Default Attack:** Add a fallback task to the root node.  If none of the high-priority conditions are met, the player should automatically perform an Attack. This ensures the player always engages in combat and prevents wasted turns.

# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
