You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

3. [Logic change description]

Be concise and actionable.

## Analysis
The BT consistently prioritized exploiting Ice weakness after scanning, despite the FireGolem's inherent Fire weakness. This led to a predictable and ultimately ineffective strategy. The BT’s reliance on scanning before using Ice spells meant the FireGolem could easily anticipate and avoid the Ice attacks. The Heal task was triggered too late, occurring after the enemy had already inflicted significant damage. The Defend task was never triggered, potentially due to a lack of telegraphing from the FireGolem, or a misconfiguration of the condition. The BT’s focus on MP-intensive spells (Ice, Fire, Lightning) without considering TP efficiency is a significant issue, especially given the limited TP pool.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Fire Weakness:** Modify the BT to trigger the FireSpell task immediately after a Scan, regardless of the Ice scan result.  The IceSpell should only be triggered if the Scan *and* FireWeakness are both confirmed. This addresses the core issue of ignoring the enemy’s primary weakness.

2.  **Heal Trigger Adjustment:** Change the Heal condition to trigger when Player HP drops below 50%, reducing the delay and increasing the chance of survival.

3.  **Defend Condition Enhancement:**  Add a broader condition to the Defend task, such as “Enemy is actively attacking” or “Enemy is performing a high-damage attack,” to increase the likelihood of the Defend task being executed.  Consider adding a visual telegraph detection condition as well.

4.  **TP Cost Consideration:** Introduce a secondary condition to the IceSpell, FireSpell, and LightningSpell tasks that checks TP availability *before* initiating the spell. If TP is low, the spell should be skipped, preventing excessive resource expenditure.

5. **Scan Frequency Reduction:** Reduce the Scan frequency from every 3 turns to every 5 turns. This conserves MP and allows for more strategic spellcasting.
