SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

Generate an IMPROVED Behaviour Tree based on feedback.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Defend against HeavySlam
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

        # IceSpell when enemy has Fire
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : IceSpell()

        # FireSpell when enemy has Ice
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : FireSpell()

        # Cleanse Debuff
        sequence :
            condition : HasStatus(AttackDown)
            condition : HasMP(25)
            task : Cleanse()

        # Heal when HP is low
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(40)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # High MP Attack
        sequence :
            condition : HasMP(40)
            task : Attack()

        # Default: Attack
        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The player consistently failed to react to the telegraphed HeavySlam attacks, repeatedly defending instead of attempting to deal damage. This resulted in significant damage taken and a quick defeat. The player didn't scan the enemy, leaving them unaware of the FireGolem’s eventual permanent Fire element. MP was used inefficiently, primarily through Heal when HP was already low, and not enough for strategic spellcasting. The overall strategy was reactive rather than proactive.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Telegraph Defense Priority**: Add a condition to the Defend() task in the tree that triggers *only* when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam. This will force the player to prioritize defense against the most dangerous attacks.

2. **Scan on Turn 1**: Modify the BT to automatically initiate a scan on turn 1. This would immediately reveal the FireGolem's weakness and allow for the strategic use of IceSpell.

3. **Adjust Heal Threshold**: Change the Heal condition from HP <= 30% to HP <= 40%. This provides a slightly larger buffer before initiating a Heal, reducing the risk of wasting MP on a Heal when the enemy is still actively attacking.

4. **Prioritize IceSpell after Scan**: After the scan reveals the Fire element, immediately trigger the IceSpell task if the player has MP. This would capitalize on the elemental weakness.

5. **Implement MP Monitoring**: Add a condition to the MP management section to alert the player if MP is critically low (e.g., < 30%) and suggest using Attack instead of Heal.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

**Tasks (ONLY these 7):**
- `Attack()` - Basic attack
- `Charge()` - Charge for next turn 2x damage
- `FireSpell()` - Fire spell
- `IceSpell()` - Ice spell
- `Defend()` - Reduce damage 50%
- `Heal()` - Heal 40 HP
- `Cleanse()` - Remove debuffs

# CRITICAL RULES

3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
