SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis

The combat highlights several key issues with the current BT strategy against IceWraith. The primary failure was a lack of proactive defense against the enemy's telegraphs, specifically the Debuff. The BT consistently defaulted to attacking without scanning for vulnerabilities. The FireSpell was used effectively when the enemy had Ice, but the overall strategy lacked responsiveness to the enemy's actions. MP was used somewhat inefficiently, with a reliance on FireSpell when a simpler solution (IceSpell) was available. The Heal was triggered too late, and the BT didn’t adapt to the enemy’s element changes.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Scan on Turn 1**: Add a "Scan" task to the BT on turn 1. This task would immediately check the enemy's element and adjust the spell selection accordingly. This addresses the lack of proactive vulnerability assessment.

2. **Defend against Debuff on Telegraph**: Add a conditional task to the BT: “If Enemy is Telegraphing (Debuff) -> Execute Defend()”. This will automatically mitigate the damage from the Debuff, preventing significant damage and the associated status effects.

3. **Prioritize IceSpell when Ice Element**: Modify the FireSpell condition to be more specific. Instead of "EnemyHasElement(Ice)", use "EnemyHasElement(Ice) AND EnemyIsTelegraphing(FrostBlast)". This ensures the IceSpell is used when the enemy is actively using FrostBlast, maximizing damage output.  This is a more precise and effective strategy than relying on a general "Ice element" condition.

4. **Adjust Heal Threshold**: Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 30% to 40%. This will allow the Heal to trigger sooner, potentially mitigating damage before the player reaches critically low HP.

5. **Implement MP Cost Prioritization**:  Add a condition to the BT that checks MP remaining before selecting a spell. If MP is below 40, prioritize Attack over FireSpell. This prevents the BT from needlessly spending MP on spells when a cheaper attack would suffice.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

**Tasks (ONLY these 7):**
- `Attack()` - Basic attack
- `Charge()` - Charge for next turn 2x damage
- `FireSpell()` - Fire spell
- `IceSpell()` - Ice spell
- `Defend()` - Reduce damage 50%
- `Heal()` - Heal 40 HP
- `Cleanse()` - Remove debuffs

# CRITICAL RULES

3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
