SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis

The combat against IceWraith highlighted several key issues with the BT’s strategy. Primarily, the BT failed to react effectively to IceWraith’s telegraphs, particularly the FrostBlast and Debuff. The BT consistently used FireSpell regardless of IceWraith’s element, demonstrating a lack of situational awareness. MP management was also suboptimal, with the BT frequently using FireSpell when it could have been more effective. Finally, the BT’s reliance on the Heal action when HP was relatively high (around 60%) was a significant waste of turns.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Scan on Turn 1**: Immediately after the start of combat, the BT should initiate a scan to determine IceWraith's element. This would provide crucial information for selecting the correct spell.

2. **Defend against FrostBlast on Turn 1**: Upon detecting IceWraith’s FrostBlast telegraph (FrostBlast), the BT should execute the Defend() action. This would mitigate the initial 22 damage.

3. **Adjust Heal Threshold**: Modify the Heal action’s trigger condition. Instead of activating at 40% HP, shift the threshold to 60% HP. This would prevent the BT from wasting turns using Heal when it's not immediately necessary.

4. **Prioritize IceSpell when Ice Element**: When IceWraith gains the Ice element (FrostBlast), immediately switch to using IceSpell instead of FireSpell. This would capitalize on the elemental advantage.

5. **Implement Elemental Scanning**: Add a condition to check for enemy element after each turn. If the enemy has gained a new element, the BT should adjust its spell selection accordingly. (This could be a simple ‘if’ statement based on the enemy’s current element).


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

**Tasks (ONLY these 7):**
- `Attack()` - Basic attack
- `Charge()` - Charge for next turn 2x damage
- `FireSpell()` - Fire spell
- `IceSpell()` - Ice spell
- `Defend()` - Reduce damage 50%
- `Heal()` - Heal 40 HP
- `Cleanse()` - Remove debuffs

# CRITICAL RULES

3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
