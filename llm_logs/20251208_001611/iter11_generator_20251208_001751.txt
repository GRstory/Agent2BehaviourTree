SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Scan on Turn 1
        sequence :
            condition : IsTurnEarly(1)
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        # Prioritized Ice Spell Usage (High HP)
        sequence :
            condition : HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : EnemyWeakTo(Ice)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            condition : IsEnemyHPLow(60)
            task : IceSpell()

        # Heal when critical, with shorter telegraph
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(50)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # Proactive Defend
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

        # Damage Burst on telegraph

            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            condition : HasTP(30)

```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem's weakness to Ice, despite scanning it. The aggressive, telegraph-dependent attack strategy (PowerStrike, HeavySlam) was repeatedly punished by the enemy’s predictable attacks. The Heal action was triggered too late, and the Defend action was triggered at the same time as the enemy’s telegraph, leading to wasted turns. The BT’s reliance on immediate reactions rather than proactive planning contributed to the defeat. The lack of adaptation to the enemy's consistent HeavySlam telegraph is a critical flaw.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Ice Spell Usage:**  Modify the IceSpell task to be executed *immediately* after scanning the enemy, regardless of HP thresholds.  The current HP conditions are too restrictive and delay the use of the most effective attack.

2.  **Dynamic Defend Trigger:** Change the Defend task to trigger *before* the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam. This would allow the player to preempt the attack and reduce damage.

3.  **Heal Trigger Adjustment:**  Increase the player HP low threshold for the Heal action from 50% to 30%.  The player was often at 50% HP, too late for the Heal to be effective.

4.  **Introduce a "Wait" Action:** Add a "Wait" action to the BT. This action would be triggered if the enemy is telegraphing an attack. This would allow the player to better anticipate the enemy's move and avoid unnecessary damage.

5. **Adaptive Scanning:**  If the enemy is consistently telegraphing HeavySlam, immediately scan again after the first scan, regardless of time. This ensures the player is always aware of the enemy's weaknesses.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
