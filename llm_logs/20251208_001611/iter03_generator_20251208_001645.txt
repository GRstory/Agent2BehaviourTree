SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree

        task : Defend()

        # Heal when critical
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(40)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # Exploit Weakness
        sequence :
            condition : HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : EnemyWeakTo(Ice)
            task : IceSpell()
            
        # Scan for Weakness
        sequence :
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently defaults to attacking and healing when low HP, but fails to proactively exploit the FireGolem’s elemental weakness. The lack of a scan before attacking is the primary issue. The BT prioritizes immediate healing over scouting for vulnerabilities. The 7-turn duration of the combat suggests a slow, reactive strategy, further exacerbated by not identifying the FireGolem’s vulnerability. The Heal task is triggered too late, as the FireGolem’s damage output likely overwhelmed the player’s defenses.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1:** Add a task to “Scan Enemy” at the very beginning of the turn. This should be a high-priority task, executed before any other action.  This ensures the player always knows the enemy’s weaknesses.

2.  **Prioritize Ice Spell:**  Re-order the ‘IceSpell’ task to be the highest priority within the ‘sequence’ that checks for weakness.  Currently, it's buried after the Scan task.

3.  **Dynamic Heal Threshold:** Change the “IsPlayerHPLow(40)” condition to “IsPlayerHPLow(20)”.  Healing at 40% HP is too late. The FireGolem's attacks would have likely reduced the player’s HP to a point where a heal wouldn’t be effective.

4.  **Conditional Scan based on MP:** Introduce a condition to the ‘Scan’ task: “HasMP(20)”. This ensures scanning isn’t attempted if the player is critically low on MP, preventing wasted resources.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
