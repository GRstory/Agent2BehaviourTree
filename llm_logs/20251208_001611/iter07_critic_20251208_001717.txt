You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem's weakness to Ice, despite having the opportunity multiple times. The reliance on `PowerStrike` was inefficient, as it didn't account for the FireGolem’s high HP and the potential for a more strategic response. The Heal action was triggered too late, only when the player was already at 0 HP. The defensive actions were reactive and didn’t proactively prevent damage. The BT’s turn 1 scan was also not utilized effectively.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Scanning:** Implement scanning on every turn (e.g., on turn 1, 2, and 3). The initial scan was missed entirely, preventing the BT from recognizing the FireGolem’s Ice weakness.
2.  **Adaptive Ice Spell Usage:** Modify the IceSpell task to have a higher priority than `PowerStrike`.  If the FireGolem is scanned and weak to Ice, *always* execute IceSpell first, regardless of TP/MP availability.  Add a condition: "IsEnemyWeakTo(Ice) AND HasScannedEnemy()"
3.  **Dynamic Heal Threshold:** Adjust the heal trigger from "IsPlayerHPLow(40)" to "IsPlayerHPLow(20)".  Healing at 40% HP is far too late.  The BT should prioritize healing when the player is critically low, closer to 60-80% HP.
4.  **Telegraph Response Prioritization:**  Re-order the BT.  The "Defend" task should be higher priority than "PowerStrike" when the FireGolem telegraphs a HeavySlam.  This will allow for a more timely defensive response.
5.  **TP/MP Cost Adjustment:** Consider increasing the MP cost of IceSpell to 30. This would force the BT to be more selective about when it uses this powerful ability, and prevent it from being used prematurely.
