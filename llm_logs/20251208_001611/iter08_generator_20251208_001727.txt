You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The combat consistently ended in defeat against the FireGolem, primarily due to a reactive and inflexible strategy. The BT heavily relies on scanning and exploiting Ice weakness *after* the enemy has telegraphed a HeavySlam. This is a fundamentally flawed approach. The FireGolem’s high HP and consistent HeavySlam telegraphs allowed it to consistently punish this delayed response. The BT doesn’t proactively manage the threat, instead reacting to the enemy’s established pattern. The Heal task is also triggered too late, as the FireGolem consistently dealt significant damage before the player could meaningfully recover. The MP expenditure on IceSpell was also inefficient, as it was only used when the enemy was already telegraphing a powerful attack.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Proactive Ice Spell Usage:** Implement IceSpell on turn 1, regardless of enemy telegraphs. The FireGolem’s predictable HeavySlam telegraphs make it vulnerable to a sustained Ice attack from the start. This should be a priority, regardless of scanning results.
2.  **Reduce Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal task from 20% to 30%. The player was waiting too long to heal, allowing the FireGolem to inflict excessive damage before the Heal was triggered.
3.  **Prioritize Scanning on Turn 1:** Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2. This ensures the BT immediately identifies the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice, allowing for a more targeted initial strategy.
4.  **Introduce a "Threat Assessment" Task:** Add a task that evaluates the enemy’s current state (HP, telegraphing behavior) and adjusts the BT’s strategy accordingly. This could involve switching to IceSpell if the FireGolem is telegraphing HeavySlam, or prioritizing defense if the enemy is actively attacking without telegraphing.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task
