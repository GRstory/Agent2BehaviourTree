You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The combat against the FireGolem highlights several critical issues with the current Behaviour Tree. Firstly, the BT consistently prioritizes exploiting the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice, but it *never* scanned to confirm this weakness. This resulted in wasted MP on Fire spells when Ice was the correct choice. Secondly, the Heal action is triggered too late, only when the player's HP is already critically low (40%).  A proactive heal would have significantly improved the outcome. Finally, the BT’s reliance on a single, broad ‘Attack’ task as a default is inefficient and doesn’t adapt to the enemy’s elemental advantage.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1:**  Add a condition to the ‘Scan for Weakness’ sequence that *must* be executed on turn 1. This ensures the BT immediately identifies the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice.

2.  **Proactive Heal Trigger:** Change the Heal action's trigger condition from ‘IsPlayerHPLow(40)’ to ‘IsPlayerHPLow(20)’. This allows for a preemptive heal before the player’s health drops to a dangerous level.

3.  **Prioritize Weakness Exploitation:**  Within the ‘Exploit Weakness’ sequence, add a condition: “EnemyWeakTo(Ice)”. This ensures the BT *only* uses Fire spells when the Ice weakness is confirmed.

4.  **Introduce a "Defend" Task on Every Turn:**  Add a "Defend()" task as the *first* task in the ‘selector’. This ensures the player is always defending, regardless of other conditions, which is crucial against a powerful enemy like the FireGolem.
