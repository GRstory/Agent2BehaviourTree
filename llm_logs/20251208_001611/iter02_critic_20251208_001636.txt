You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The combat repeatedly devolved into a prolonged, inefficient exchange with the FireGolem. The core issue is the reliance on a single, unadaptive defense strategy combined with a reactive, but ultimately ineffective, spell usage. The BT prioritizes defending, which is sensible, but doesn't account for the enemy’s consistent fire attacks. The ‘FireSpell’ task is only triggered when a weakness is scanned, and the scan happens infrequently. The low MP cost of the ‘FireSpell’ means it’s frequently used, but it doesn’t meaningfully damage the enemy. The lack of proactive adaptation and the rigid defense strategy led to the FireGolem reaching full health before the player could effectively respond. The early scan task, while intended to be proactive, doesn't translate into timely strategic advantage.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement Weakness Scanning on Every Turn:**  Change the ‘Scan’ task to execute on every turn, regardless of turn number. This ensures the BT is always attempting to identify the enemy’s weakness.

2.  **Prioritize Ice Spell Usage:** Modify the ‘FireSpell’ task to *always* be selected when an enemy weakness is detected, regardless of MP availability.  The BT should always attempt to exploit the enemy's weakness.

3.  **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the heal threshold from 20% to 40%.  The player was waiting too long to heal, allowing the FireGolem to build up significant damage before the heal was initiated.

4. **Introduce a ‘Defend’ on Turn 1:** Add a ‘Defend’ task as the *very first* action in the BT. This provides immediate protection while the BT evaluates the situation.

5. **Add a 'Damage' task:** Introduce a basic 'Attack' task that always executes, even if a weakness isn't identified. This ensures consistent damage output, even when the BT is scanning or preparing for a more strategic attack.
