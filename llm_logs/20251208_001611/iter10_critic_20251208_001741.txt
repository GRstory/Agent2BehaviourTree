SYSTEM PROMPT

You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The combat consistently resulted in defeat against the FireGolem, primarily due to a rigid and reactive behaviour tree. The BT prioritized Ice spells aggressively, failing to adapt to the enemy’s inherent Fire weakness. The frequent use of Ice spells, coupled with the lack of strategic scanning and TP/MP management, left the player vulnerable to the FireGolem’s sustained damage. The Heal action was triggered too late, and the Defend action was triggered by a telegraph that never materialized, leading to wasted turns. The BT’s reliance on a single action per turn, coupled with the aggressive Ice spell prioritization, prevented the player from effectively exploiting the FireGolem’s weakness.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Scanning on Turn 1:** Implement a scan action on turn 1 to immediately confirm the FireGolem’s vulnerability to Ice. This should be the first action performed on each turn, regardless of other conditions.
2.  **Dynamic Ice Spell Prioritization:** Introduce a dynamic Ice spell prioritization based on enemy HP.  If the FireGolem’s HP is above 60%, prioritize Ice spells. If below 60%, consider other damage actions. This prevents wasting MP on a spell that isn't effective.
3.  **Heal Trigger Adjustment:** Increase the heal trigger from 20% HP to 50% HP. This allows for proactive healing and prevents the player from being reduced to near-zero HP.
4.  **Defend Condition Refinement:** Modify the Defend condition to require a more reliable telegraph, such as a distinct "Prepare to Slam" animation, rather than just a general "Telegraphing" condition. This reduces wasted turns.
5.  **Introduce a "Default" Attack with TP Management:** Add a default attack action that consumes TP, but only when no other prioritized actions are available. This ensures TP isn’t completely wasted.
