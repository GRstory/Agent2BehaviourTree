You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The combat consistently resulted in defeat against the FireGolem, primarily due to a rigid and reactive behaviour tree. The BT prioritized Ice spells aggressively, failing to adapt to the enemy’s inherent Fire weakness. The frequent use of Ice spells, coupled with the lack of strategic scanning and TP/MP management, left the player vulnerable to the FireGolem’s sustained damage. The Heal action was triggered too late, and the Defend action was triggered by a telegraph that never materialized, leading to wasted turns. The BT’s reliance on a single action per turn, coupled with the aggressive Ice spell prioritization, prevented the player from effectively exploiting the FireGolem’s weakness.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Scanning on Turn 1:** Implement a scan action on turn 1 to immediately confirm the FireGolem’s vulnerability to Ice. This should be the first action performed on each turn, regardless of other conditions.
2.  **Dynamic Ice Spell Prioritization:** Introduce a dynamic Ice spell prioritization based on enemy HP.  If the FireGolem’s HP is above 60%, prioritize Ice spells. If below 60%, consider other damage actions. This prevents wasting MP on a spell that isn't effective.
3.  **Heal Trigger Adjustment:** Increase the heal trigger from 20% HP to 50% HP. This allows for proactive healing and prevents the player from being reduced to near-zero HP.
4.  **Defend Condition Refinement:** Modify the Defend condition to require a more reliable telegraph, such as a distinct "Prepare to Slam" animation, rather than just a general "Telegraphing" condition. This reduces wasted turns.
5.  **Introduce a "Default" Attack with TP Management:** Add a default attack action that consumes TP, but only when no other prioritized actions are available. This ensures TP isn’t completely wasted.

# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
