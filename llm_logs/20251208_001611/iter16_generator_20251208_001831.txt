You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem's weakness to Ice. Despite scanning the enemy, the BT prioritized Fire spells due to the ‘HasScannedEnemy’ condition, which is too broad. The MP usage was also inefficient, with the FireSpell and LightningSpell being prioritized over IceSpell when the enemy was identified as weak to Ice. The Heal action was triggered too late, only when the player’s HP was already low, and the Defend action was triggered prematurely when the enemy was telegraphing a HeavySlam, which wasn’t actually executed. The lack of proactive Ice spell usage directly contributed to the defeat.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Ice Spell on Scan:** Modify the ‘HasScannedEnemy’ condition to *always* trigger the IceSpell if the enemy is identified as weak to Ice. This ensures the BT immediately utilizes the most effective spell.

2.  **Adjust Heal Trigger:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 60% to 70%. This will allow the BT to heal earlier, potentially preventing the player from reaching critically low HP.

3.  **Conditional Scan Trigger Delay:** Delay the ‘IsTurnEarly’ scan trigger from turn 2 to turn 3. This provides a slightly longer window for the scan to complete and reduces the risk of scanning too early and missing the enemy's telegraph.

4. **Introduce MP Cost Consideration for Ice Spell:** Add a condition to the IceSpell task to check if MP is sufficient *before* executing the spell. If MP is insufficient, the IceSpell should be skipped, preventing wasted MP. This forces the BT to make a resource-conscious decision.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
