SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

Generate an IMPROVED Behaviour Tree based on feedback.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Scan on Turn 1
        sequence :
            NOT HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        # Defend against HeavySlam
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()
        
        # IceSpell if weak and scanned
        sequence :
            HasScannedEnemy()
            EnemyWeakTo(Fire)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : IceSpell()

        # Heal if low HP
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(50)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # Cleanse Burn/AttackDown
        sequence :
            condition : HasMP(25)
            # Implied condition: Burn or AttackDown is active
            task : Cleanse()
        
        # Default: Attack
        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently used IceSpell despite not scanning and failing to recognize IceWraith’s element change. The reliance on IceSpell when the enemy was actively gaining Ice element was a critical error. The BT lacked a reactive element scan and didn’t adapt to the changing enemy state. The constant use of Cleanse without considering the active ailment (FrostTouch) was also inefficient. Finally, the BT didn't prioritize defense against the telegraphing FrostTouch.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement Element Scan on Turn 1:** Add a Scan action to the BT on turn 1. This will immediately reveal the enemy's element (Neutral to Ice) and allow the BT to prioritize IceSpell.
2.  **Conditional IceSpell Trigger:** Modify the IceSpell task to only execute if the enemy's element is Ice. This will prevent using IceSpell when it’s ineffective.
3.  **Prioritize Defense against FrostTouch:** Add a Defend() task that is triggered when the enemy telegraphs FrostTouch. This would have significantly reduced damage taken during the early turns.
4. **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for Heal from 50% to 60%. This will allow the player to heal more frequently, especially given the constant damage from FrostTouch.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` - Enemy weak to element (DYNAMIC! Can change during combat)
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
