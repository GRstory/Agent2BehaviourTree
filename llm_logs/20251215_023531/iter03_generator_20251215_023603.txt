SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

Generate an IMPROVED Behaviour Tree based on feedback.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Scan on Turn 1
        sequence :
            NOT HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        # Defend against IceSpell
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(IceSpell)
            task : Defend()
            
        # Heal after IceSpell and low HP
        sequence :
            EnemyWeakTo(Ice)
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(40)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # Cleanse Burn/AttackDown
        sequence :
            condition : HasMP(25)
            # Implied condition: Burn or AttackDown is active
            task : Cleanse()

        # FireSpell if weak
        sequence :
            EnemyWeakTo(Ice)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : FireSpell()
        
        # Default: Attack
        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently reacted to the FireGolem’s HeavySlam telegraphs with Cleanse, but failed to proactively defend or utilize the FireGolem’s eventual Fire element. The BT did not scan, leaving the player unaware of the critical weakness. The repeated Cleanse actions were a waste of MP, as they didn't prevent the damage and did not address the underlying problem (the HeavySlam telegraphs). The lack of a defensive action against the HeavySlam telegraphs was a major factor in the defeat.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam**: Immediately upon the enemy telegraphing a HeavySlam, execute the Defend action. This would mitigate a significant portion of the damage.
2.  **Scan on Turn 1**:  Implement a Scan action on Turn 1. This would reveal the FireGolem’s weakness, allowing the player to immediately use the IceSpell.
3.  **Adjust Heal Threshold**: Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 40% to 50%. This would allow the Heal to be used more frequently when the player is closer to death.
4.  **Prioritize IceSpell after Scan**: If Scan reveals Fire element, immediately use IceSpell. This directly addresses the FireGolem’s weakness.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` - Enemy weak to element (DYNAMIC! Can change during combat)
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
