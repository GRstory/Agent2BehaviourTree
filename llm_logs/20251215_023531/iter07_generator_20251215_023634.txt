SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

Generate an IMPROVED Behaviour Tree based on feedback.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Defend against HeavySlam
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

        # Scan on Turn 1
        sequence :
            NOT HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        # IceSpell if weak and scanned
        sequence :
            HasScannedEnemy()
            EnemyWeakTo(Fire)
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : IceSpell()

        # Heal if low HP
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(80)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # Cleanse Burn/AttackDown
        sequence :
            condition : HasMP(25)
            selector:

                condition : EnemyHasBuff(AttackDown)

```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently defaulted to defending against HeavySlam, even when the enemy telegraphed it repeatedly. This was a reactive, not proactive, strategy. The BT didn’t scan, leading to a failure to identify the FireGolem’s phase 2 weakness (Fire element). MP was used inefficiently – primarily on heals when a more strategic spell could have been used. The lack of proactive scanning and elemental awareness directly contributed to the defeat.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize Scanning:** Add a condition to the BT to automatically trigger a Scan action on turn 1. This should be a high priority task to identify the enemy's weakness.
2. **Elemental Response - FireSpell Priority:**  Modify the IceSpell task to only activate if the enemy is *not* in the Fire element state.  If the enemy is Fire, immediately trigger a FireSpell. This addresses the core issue of using the wrong spell.
3. **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 80% to 70%. This will allow the BT to heal more frequently and potentially prevent critical HP drops.
4. **Defend - Telegraphed HeavySlam:** Add a condition to the Defend action that triggers *only* when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam. This prevents the BT from wasting defense on non-telegraphed attacks.
5. **Scan on Turn 1:** Change the Scan action to be triggered on turn 1 instead of turn 2. This ensures the scan happens immediately at the start of the combat.

# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` - Enemy weak to element (DYNAMIC! Can change during combat)
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
