SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Heal when critical
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(20)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()
        
        # Default: Attack
        task : Attack()

```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The player consistently attacked without adapting to the FireGolem’s fire weakness. The default ‘Attack’ task was executed every turn, leading to predictable damage output and no exploitation of the enemy’s vulnerability. There was no scanning for elemental weaknesses, and no defensive actions were taken despite the FireGolem’s high HP. The lack of a proactive strategy resulted in a rapid drain of the player's health.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement Elemental Scanning:** Add a ‘Scan’ task that runs at the beginning of each turn. This task should check if the enemy has a weakness to the player’s current attack type. If a weakness is detected, the scan task should trigger the appropriate spell selection.
2.  **Introduce a Defensive Trigger:** Add a ‘IsEnemyHPLow’ condition to the ‘Attack’ task. If the enemy’s HP falls below 75%, the ‘Attack’ task should switch to a ‘Defend’ task for one turn, conserving TP.
3.  **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Modify the ‘IsPlayerHPLow’ condition to trigger a ‘Heal’ task when the player’s HP drops below 50%, rather than 20%. This provides a more substantial healing opportunity.
4.  **Prioritize Scanning:** Ensure the ‘Scan’ task runs at the start of *every* turn, not just on turn 2. This guarantees the player always has the information needed to make the optimal decision.

# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
