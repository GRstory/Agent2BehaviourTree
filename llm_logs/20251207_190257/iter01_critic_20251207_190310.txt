You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The combat repeatedly failed to capitalize on the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice, despite scanning it. The Heal task was triggered frequently, but never when it mattered most – the FireGolem’s health remained high. The MP expenditure on Fire and Lightning spells was inefficient, as they weren’t consistently used. The Defend task was triggered too late, after the enemy had already inflicted significant damage. The BT prioritizes scanning, which is good, but doesn’t effectively translate into damage output.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Ice Spell on Weakness Scan:** Modify the BT to immediately execute the IceSpell task when the FireGolem is scanned and revealed to be weak to Ice.  This should be the highest priority within the "HasScannedEnemy" sequence.

2.  **Conditional Heal Trigger:**  Adjust the Heal task's trigger condition. Instead of just ‘IsPlayerHPLow(50)’, make it ‘IsPlayerHPLow(20) AND EnemyHP > 70’ – meaning heal only when the player is low *and* the enemy is still significantly healthy.

3.  **Defend Trigger Adjustment:**  Move the Defend task trigger to ‘IsEnemyHPLow(50)’. This will allow for a more proactive defensive stance, preventing the FireGolem from reaching critical health before a counter-attack can be launched.

4.  **Introduce a 'Counter-Attack' Task:** Add a task to the ‘HasScannedEnemy’ sequences to attempt a basic attack when the enemy is scanned. This provides a more immediate response to the enemy's presence and prevents the BT from simply waiting for the next scan. This task should have a low MP cost.
