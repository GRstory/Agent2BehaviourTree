You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

Be concise and actionable.

## Analysis
The combat consistently resulted in defeat, primarily due to a reactive and inflexible behaviour tree. The FireGolem’s inherent Fire weakness was not consistently exploited, and the BT lacked prioritization. The ‘Defend’ task was triggered too late, allowing the FireGolem to inflict significant damage.  The TP/MP usage was inefficient – the BT was attempting to cast Ice and Fire spells simultaneously, without considering the optimal resource allocation. The attack every 3 turns was ineffective given the enemy’s aggressive nature and the lack of proactive scanning. The BT’s reliance on scanning before spellcasting was also a weakness, as the FireGolem didn’t telegraph its attacks reliably enough for this to be a reliable strategy.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Scanning:** Implement scanning on every turn (turn 1). This allows for continuous enemy assessment and immediate exploitation of weaknesses.
2.  **Conditional Spellcasting Based on Scan Results:** Modify the 'IceSpell' and 'FireSpell' tasks.  The IceSpell task should only execute *after* a successful scan and confirmation of the FireGolem's Ice weakness. Similarly, the FireSpell should only trigger after a scan and confirmation of the FireGolem’s Fire weakness.
3.  **Dynamic Defend Trigger:** Adjust the 'Defend' task's trigger condition. Instead of solely relying on the enemy telegraphing a HeavySlam, incorporate a broader trigger: "EnemyHPBelow(60)" – this would allow for defensive action regardless of telegraphing, providing a more immediate response to damage.
4. **Resource Prioritization:**  Introduce a resource management layer.  If the scan reveals a weakness, prioritize MP usage for the corresponding spell.  Implement a mechanism to automatically reduce TP usage if a spell isn’t used due to MP depletion.
5. **Reduce Attack Frequency:**  Remove the "Attack every 3 turns" task. The BT should focus on reacting to the enemy’s actions rather than following a rigid timing schedule.
