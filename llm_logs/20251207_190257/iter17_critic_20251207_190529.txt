SYSTEM PROMPT

You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem's Ice weakness despite scanning it. The MP was spent on Fire spells, which is entirely ineffective. The Heal action was triggered too late, only when the player was already at 0 HP. The Defend action was triggered prematurely based on low HP, potentially interrupting advantageous attacks. The BT's reactive nature, combined with the lack of strategic targeting, led to a swift defeat. The high TP usage of PowerStrike when it wasn't needed further contributed to the problem.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Scanning:** Implement a more aggressive scanning strategy. Scan on turn 1, then every 2 turns, regardless of the current turn number. This ensures the weakness is consistently identified.

2.  **Weakness Targeting Priority:**  Modify the BT so that *immediately* after scanning an enemy, the BT attempts to cast the corresponding weakness spell if available and if MP is sufficient.  Introduce a higher priority for weakness spells.  For example, "If scanned enemy is weak to Ice, and MP > 20, then cast IceSpell immediately."

3.  **Heal Threshold Adjustment:** Increase the heal trigger threshold from 80% to 60%.  Waiting until 80% HP is too late to meaningfully impact the battle.  A 60% trigger allows for proactive healing.

4.  **PowerStrike Deactivation:** Remove the PowerStrike task entirely. It's not being used effectively and is consuming valuable TP.

5.  **Defend Trigger Refinement:** Adjust the Defend trigger conditions. Instead of simply low HP, make it “Defend if HP is below 70% *and* the enemy is actively attacking.” This prevents unnecessary Defends when the enemy isn’t posing an immediate threat.
