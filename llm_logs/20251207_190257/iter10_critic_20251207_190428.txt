SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice. Despite scanning and having sufficient MP and TP, the FireSpell was prioritized over IceSpell, leading to a prolonged fight and eventual defeat. The Heal action was triggered too late, only when the player's HP was critically low, and the Defend action was triggered reactively, not proactively. The BT’s reactive nature and prioritization of damage spells over exploiting weaknesses contributed significantly to the losses.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Ice Spell:** Modify the ‘Prioritize Ice Spell’ sequence to have a higher priority than the FireSpell.  Implement a priority score system: IceSpell > FireSpell > LightningSpell > Attack. This should be a hard-coded priority, not reliant on scanning.
2.  **Proactive Defend:**  Introduce a ‘Defend’ task with a higher priority, triggered when the enemy is actively telegraphing an attack (HeavySlam) *and* the player's HP is above 60%. This prevents the player from being caught off guard.
3.  **Heal Trigger:** Adjust the ‘Emergency Heal’ condition to trigger at 30% HP, instead of 40%.  This will allow for more timely healing and prevent the player from being reduced to critical health.
4. **Scan Frequency:** Increase scan frequency to every turn. This will allow the BT to quickly identify enemy weaknesses.
5. **Introduce a ‘Wait’ Task:** Add a ‘Wait’ task with a low priority, triggered when the enemy is not actively attacking and the player has sufficient resources. This would allow the BT to assess the situation and potentially prioritize a different strategy.
