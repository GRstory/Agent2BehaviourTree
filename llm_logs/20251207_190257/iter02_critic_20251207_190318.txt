You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The BT consistently fails to capitalize on the FireGolem's weakness to Ice. The ‘Exploit weakness’ selector is active, but only triggered after the enemy has been scanned. The BT prioritizes MP usage for Ice spells *after* scanning, leading to a delay. The Heal task is always active, regardless of the enemy’s state, consuming MP unnecessarily. The Defend task is triggered too late, and the default Attack task is always active, offering no strategic advantage. The lack of proactive scanning is a major issue.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Scanning:** Implement scanning on turn 1, immediately after the player's turn begins. This allows the BT to identify enemy weaknesses faster.
2.  **Conditional Heal:** Modify the Heal task to only activate when the player is critically low *and* the enemy is significantly damaged.  Increase the enemy HP threshold for healing from 70 to 80.
3.  **MP Prioritization:**  Reorder the ‘Exploit weakness’ selectors.  Place the IceSpell task *before* the FireSpell and LightningSpell tasks. This ensures the BT always attempts to exploit the Ice weakness first.
4.  **Defend on Threat:** Adjust the Defend task's trigger condition to be based on a more dynamic threat assessment. Instead of just low enemy HP, consider enemy attack damage or special abilities.
5.  **Introduce a ‘Scan’ Task:** Add a dedicated ‘Scan’ task that runs on turn 1 and updates the enemy’s weakness information. This task should be triggered *before* any other action, ensuring the BT always has the most up-to-date information.
