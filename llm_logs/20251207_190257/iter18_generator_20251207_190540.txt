SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently fails to capitalize on the FireGolem’s weakness to Ice, despite scanning it. The aggressive scanning is triggered frequently, but the subsequent IceSpell execution is rarely attempted due to the MP cost and potentially delayed execution. The Heal task is triggered too late, after the player's HP has already been critically low. The Defend task is also triggered late, after significant damage has been taken. The overall strategy feels reactive rather than proactive, failing to efficiently exploit the enemy’s vulnerability. The frequent scanning doesn’t translate into effective spell usage.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize IceSpell on Scan:**  Modify the IceSpell task to have a higher priority within the ‘Exploit Weakness’ sequence.  Specifically, make the IceSpell task’s priority higher than the FireSpell task. This ensures the IceSpell is attempted immediately after scanning the enemy and identifying the weakness.

2.  **Reduce Heal Threshold:** Adjust the ‘IsPlayerHPLow’ condition for the Heal task. Lower the HP threshold from 60% to 40%. This will trigger the Heal task earlier, potentially mitigating damage before it becomes critical.

3.  **Introduce MP Cost Consideration:** Add a condition to the ‘Exploit Weakness’ sequence to check MP availability *before* executing the IceSpell.  If MP is below 20, the IceSpell should be skipped, preventing wasted MP.

4.  **Delay Defend Trigger:**  Shift the ‘Defend’ task’s trigger to a lower HP threshold, say 80%, and introduce a short delay (1 turn) after the Telegraphing condition is met. This allows the player to absorb some initial damage before committing to the defensive action.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
