You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The BT consistently fails to capitalize on the FireGolem's weakness to Ice, despite scanning it. The aggressive "Attack" tasks are triggered too frequently, leading to rapid HP depletion. The Heal task is triggered too late, and the TP/MP management is poor; the FireSpell and LightningSpell are only activated when TP and MP are available, but not consistently. The BT doesn't adapt to the enemy's telegraphing, continuing to attack aggressively.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Ice Spell after Scan:** Immediately after scanning the FireGolem, execute the IceSpell task.  Remove the conditional `HasMP(20)` from the IceSpell task. The BT should always attempt to use the most effective spell against a scanned enemy.

2.  **Adaptive Attack Frequency:** Introduce a cooldown on the "Attack" task.  Limit aggressive attacks to every 3 turns to prevent early HP loss.  This should be a global cooldown, not tied to specific conditions.

3.  **Heal Threshold Adjustment:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal task from 60% to 80%. This will allow the BT to initiate healing sooner, preventing critical damage.

4.  **TP/MP Prioritization:** Introduce a secondary condition to the IceSpell and FireSpell tasks: "HasTP(10)". This ensures that the BT attempts to use TP alongside MP, increasing the likelihood of executing spells when resources are available.
