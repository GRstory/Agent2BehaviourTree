You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Current Behaviour Tree

        # Scan for telegraphing at the start of each turn
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

            condition : IsTurnEarly(1)
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        # Heal when critical and enemy is strong
        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(60)

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently failed to capitalize on the FireGolem's weakness to Ice, despite scanning it. The reliance on the default ‘Attack’ task at the end of the tree meant the player was vulnerable when the FireGolem wasn't actively attacking.  The Heal task was triggered too late, only when the player was already at 0 HP, and the TP/MP usage was inefficient – the FireSpell was only attempted when the player had 20 TP and 20 MP, which was rarely the case.  The BT’s structure doesn’t prioritize IceSpell effectively, leading to missed opportunities.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize IceSpell Earlier:** Shift the IceSpell task to be executed when the enemy is scanned *and* the enemy is weak to Ice.  Currently, it’s only triggered after scanning and then potentially being weak, which is too late.

2.  **Dynamic TP/MP Allocation:** Modify the IceSpell task to consume TP and MP based on enemy HP percentage.  For example, if the FireGolem is at 80% HP, the IceSpell should consume 25 TP and 25 MP.  This ensures the most impactful spell is used when the enemy is most vulnerable.

3.  **Defend on Telegraphed HeavySlam:**  The ‘Defend’ task should be triggered *immediately* upon detection of the FireGolem’s HeavySlam telegraph. This prevents taking unnecessary damage during the telegraph.

4.  **Heal Trigger Adjustment:** Adjust the Heal task's trigger to be when the player's HP is below 50% *and* the enemy is above 60% HP. This ensures the heal is used proactively when the player is most at risk.

5. **Introduce a "Scan Priority"**: Add a higher priority task to scan the enemy at the beginning of each turn, regardless of other conditions. This ensures the enemy’s weaknesses are always known.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasTP(30)` - Player has >= amount TP
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Lightning)` - Enemy weak to element
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy telegraphing attack
- `IsTurnEarly(2)` - Turn count <= threshold

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - 0 TP, 15-18 damage, gains +15 TP
- `PowerStrike()` - 30 TP, 40-50 damage
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Fire damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Ice damage, 1.5x vs Lightning
- `LightningSpell()` - 20 MP, 25-30 Lightning damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - 0 TP, -50% damage for 1 turn, gains +20 TP
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
