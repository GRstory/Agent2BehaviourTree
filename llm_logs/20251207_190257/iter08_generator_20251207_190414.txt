--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once an action is selected, the turn ends immediately.

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (Fire/Ice/Lightning rock-paper-scissors)
- Resource management (TP/MP optimization)
- Status effect timing and usage
- Enemy pattern recognition and adaptation
- Defensive vs aggressive strategy selection

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The combat consistently resulted in defeat against the FireGolem, lasting 7 turns. The BT’s reliance on scanning and then executing spells based on a single scanned weakness proved ineffective. The FireGolem’s high HP and consistent Fire attacks overwhelmed the player’s ability to capitalize on the scanned weakness. The BT’s structure – a complex selector with multiple conditional sequences – likely led to inefficient decision-making, prioritizing less impactful spells when the enemy was already heavily damaged. The lack of proactive defense, combined with the slow, reactive nature of the spell selection, contributed to the prolonged battle. The MP/TP management was not optimized for sustained damage output.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Immediate Threat Reduction:** Introduce a higher priority “Defend” task that triggers automatically when the enemy HP is above 60%, regardless of scan results. This would immediately mitigate the FireGolem's damage output.

2.  **Adaptive Scan Frequency:**  Change the Scan task to occur on every turn, rather than just every other turn.  This ensures the player is constantly aware of the enemy’s weaknesses and potential vulnerabilities.

3.  **Heal Trigger Adjustment:** Modify the Heal task’s trigger condition to be more aggressive, such as “IsPlayerHPLow(30)” instead of “IsPlayerHPLow(20)”.  Waiting until 20% HP is too late to prevent significant damage.

4.  **MP/TP Prioritization:** Introduce a new task called "Resource Optimization" that runs at the beginning of each turn. This task checks if the player has sufficient MP and TP to perform a high-damage spell (e.g., IceSpell) *before* allowing any other tasks to execute. This prevents wasting resources on less effective spells when a powerful attack is possible.

5. **Introduce a "Counterattack" Task:** Add a simple "Attack" task that is always available, even if other tasks are active. This ensures the player always has a basic offensive option and prevents the BT from becoming completely paralyzed waiting for a specific condition to be met.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
