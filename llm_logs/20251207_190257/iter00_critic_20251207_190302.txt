SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Combat Summary
=== COMBAT SUMMARY ===

Result: DEFEAT
Turns: 4
Final Player HP: 0/100 (0%)
Final Enemy HP: 160/180 (88%)

Enemy: FireGolem (Fire)
Weakness: Unknown (not scanned)

Resources Remaining: TP 100/100, MP 100/100


# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The player consistently attacked without adapting to the FireGolem’s fire weakness. The default ‘Attack’ task was executed every turn, leading to predictable damage output and no exploitation of the enemy’s vulnerability. There was no scanning for elemental weaknesses, and no defensive actions were taken despite the FireGolem’s high HP. The lack of a proactive strategy resulted in a rapid drain of the player's health.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Implement Elemental Scanning:** Add a ‘Scan’ task that runs at the beginning of each turn. This task should check if the enemy has a weakness to the player’s current attack type. If a weakness is detected, the scan task should trigger the appropriate spell selection.
2.  **Introduce a Defensive Trigger:** Add a ‘IsEnemyHPLow’ condition to the ‘Attack’ task. If the enemy’s HP falls below 75%, the ‘Attack’ task should switch to a ‘Defend’ task for one turn, conserving TP.
3.  **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Modify the ‘IsPlayerHPLow’ condition to trigger a ‘Heal’ task when the player’s HP drops below 50%, rather than 20%. This provides a more substantial healing opportunity.
4.  **Prioritize Scanning:** Ensure the ‘Scan’ task runs at the start of *every* turn, not just on turn 2. This guarantees the player always has the information needed to make the optimal decision.
