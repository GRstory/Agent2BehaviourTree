You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: Remember that the Behaviour Tree executes ONLY ONE action per turn. The BT cannot perform multiple actions in a single turn.

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- Elemental advantage usage (did they exploit weakness?)
- Resource efficiency (TP/MP management)
- Status effect timing
- Defensive decisions (Defend, Heal timing)
- Enemy pattern adaptation

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
2. **Resource Management**: TP/MP usage efficiency
3. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
4. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

## Analysis
The combat consistently resulted in defeat against the FireGolem, lasting 7 turns. The BT’s reliance on scanning and then executing spells based on a single scanned weakness proved ineffective. The FireGolem’s high HP and consistent Fire attacks overwhelmed the player’s ability to capitalize on the scanned weakness. The BT’s structure – a complex selector with multiple conditional sequences – likely led to inefficient decision-making, prioritizing less impactful spells when the enemy was already heavily damaged. The lack of proactive defense, combined with the slow, reactive nature of the spell selection, contributed to the prolonged battle. The MP/TP management was not optimized for sustained damage output.

## Improvement Suggestions
1.  **Prioritize Immediate Threat Reduction:** Introduce a higher priority “Defend” task that triggers automatically when the enemy HP is above 60%, regardless of scan results. This would immediately mitigate the FireGolem's damage output.

2.  **Adaptive Scan Frequency:**  Change the Scan task to occur on every turn, rather than just every other turn.  This ensures the player is constantly aware of the enemy’s weaknesses and potential vulnerabilities.

3.  **Heal Trigger Adjustment:** Modify the Heal task’s trigger condition to be more aggressive, such as “IsPlayerHPLow(30)” instead of “IsPlayerHPLow(20)”.  Waiting until 20% HP is too late to prevent significant damage.

4.  **MP/TP Prioritization:** Introduce a new task called "Resource Optimization" that runs at the beginning of each turn. This task checks if the player has sufficient MP and TP to perform a high-damage spell (e.g., IceSpell) *before* allowing any other tasks to execute. This prevents wasting resources on less effective spells when a powerful attack is possible.

5. **Introduce a "Counterattack" Task:** Add a simple "Attack" task that is always available, even if other tasks are active. This ensures the player always has a basic offensive option and prevents the BT from becoming completely paralyzed waiting for a specific condition to be met.
