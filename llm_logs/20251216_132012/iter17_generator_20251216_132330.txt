SYSTEM PROMPT

You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
- Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
- Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness), can gain Fire/Ice element during combat
- **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **CRITICAL: Use FireSpell when enemy HAS Ice element (Fire beats Ice!)**
- **CRITICAL: Use IceSpell when enemy HAS Fire element (Ice beats Fire!)**
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 5): Phase 2 (HP < 50%) gains Fire element automatically, FlameStrike adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Gains Ice element when it uses FrostBlast (3 turns), Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)
- **Element checking**: Use EnemyHasElement(Fire/Ice/Neutral) to check enemy's current element

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
 elaborated response

## Analysis

The BT struggled significantly with anticipating and reacting to the FireGolem’s heavy attacks. The most glaring issue was the repeated failure to defend against the HeavySlam telegraph. The BT consistently defaulted to attacking, even when the telegraph was present, leading to substantial damage.  Resource management was also suboptimal; the BT relied heavily on healing after taking damage, rather than proactively preventing damage.  The lack of scanning at the start of the fight was a major missed opportunity to identify the enemy's primary attack pattern.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Implement Telegraph Detection & Defensive Response:** Add logic to automatically execute `Defend()` when the enemy telegraphs `HeavySlam`. This should be triggered immediately upon seeing the telegraph, prioritizing defense over attack.

2. **Scan on Turn 1:**  Modify the BT to perform a scan on turn 1. The scan should identify the FireGolem's primary attack as `HeavySlam`. This information should be stored and used to prioritize defensive actions.

3. **Adjust Healing Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for using the `Heal()` action from 40% to 50%. This will allow the BT to heal more proactively, reducing the reliance on healing after taking significant damage. This is based on the fact that the BT was consistently taking damage before healing, indicating a need for more preventative measures.

4. **Prioritize Scanning:** If the scan fails on turn 1, add a secondary scan on turn 2 as a fallback. This ensures that the BT will eventually identify the enemy's main attack.

5. **Reduce Attack Frequency:** Reduce the frequency of the `Attack()` action, especially after the enemy telegraphs `HeavySlam`. This will minimize the risk of taking unnecessary damage.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyHasElement(Fire)`, `EnemyHasElement(Ice)`, or `EnemyHasElement(Neutral)` - Check enemy's current element (DYNAMIC! Changes during combat)
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**CRITICAL SPELL USAGE EXAMPLES:**
```
# When enemy HAS Ice element → Use FireSpell (Fire beats Ice!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Ice)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : FireSpell()  # 1.5x damage!

# When enemy HAS Fire element → Use IceSpell (Ice beats Fire!)
sequence :
    condition : EnemyHasElement(Fire)
    condition : HasMP(20)
    task : IceSpell()  # 1.5x damage!
```

**Tasks (ONLY these 7):**
- `Attack()` - Basic attack
- `Charge()` - Charge for next turn 2x damage
- `FireSpell()` - Fire spell
- `IceSpell()` - Ice spell
- `Defend()` - Reduce damage 50%
- `Heal()` - Heal 40 HP
- `Cleanse()` - Remove debuffs

# CRITICAL RULES

3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
