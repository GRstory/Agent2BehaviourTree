You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS (7 total):
- Attack: Free, 9 damage, +10 MP (resource recovery!)
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (1.5x when enemy has Ice element), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (1.5x when enemy has Fire element), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction (ONLY blocks damage, NOT status effects like Debuff/Burn!)
- Heal: 30 MP, +40 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

VICTORY REQUIREMENTS:
- **FireGolem**: 180 HP / 35 turns = **5.1+ DPS minimum**
- **IceWraith**: 200 HP / 35 turns = **5.7+ DPS minimum**
- **Baseline**: Attack alone = 9 dmg/turn (sufficient if no wasted turns)
- **Target**: 5-6+ effective DPS for consistent wins

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- **CHARGE STRATEGY**:
  - Charge gives CHARGED status (visible in combat log as "Ailments: Charged")
  - CHARGED status doubles damage on NEXT turn ONLY
  - **CRITICAL**: Use HasStatus(CHARGED) condition to detect and cash in the buff!
  - **Common mistake**: Using Charge but never following up with attack → wasted MP and damage
  - **Correct pattern**: Charge → (next turn) Attack/Spell with 2x damage
  - **Example waste**: "Turn 5: Charge → Turn 6: Defend" = CHARGED buff wasted!
  - **Math**: Charge (7 dmg) + CHARGED Attack (18 dmg) = 25 dmg / 2 turns = 12.5 DPS ✓
  
- **CLEANSE USAGE**:
  - **ONLY use when HasStatus(Burn) OR HasStatus(AttackDown)**
  - **Common bug**: Cleanse spam without debuffs → 0 damage output
  - **Correct condition**: `HasStatus(Burn)` or `HasStatus(AttackDown)` MUST be checked
  - **Value**: Cleanse removes Burn (saves 30 dmg) or AttackDown (restores 20% damage)
  
- **DEFEND MECHANICS**:
  - Defend reduces damage by 50% (e.g., HeavySlam 45 dmg → 22 dmg)
  - **Defend does NOT prevent status effects** (Debuff, Burn still applied!)
  - **Primary use**: Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam (45 dmg → 22 dmg)
  - **Debuff telegraph**: Defend CAN reduce Debuff turn damage, BUT:
    - You still get AttackDown (-20% damage for 3 turns)
    - **Better strategy**: Attack (deal damage) → next turn Cleanse (remove debuff)
    - Defend = 0 damage dealt, Cleanse costs 25 MP anyway
  
- **ELEMENTAL SYSTEM**:
  - Fire attacks deal 1.5x damage to Ice element enemies
  - Ice attacks deal 1.5x damage to Fire element enemies
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies may gain Fire or Ice element during battle
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
  - **CRITICAL: Player attacks do NOT change enemy element**
- **IceWraith Element Change**:
  - Starts as Neutral (no weakness)
  - When IceWraith uses **FrostBlast** → Gains Ice element for 3 turns
  - When Ice element expires → Returns to Neutral
  - **USE FIRESPELL WHEN ENEMY HAS ICE ELEMENT!**
- **FireGolem Element Change**:
  - Phase 1 (HP > 50%): Neutral element
  - **Phase 2 (HP < 50% = 90 HP)**: Automatically gains Fire element (permanent)
  - **CRITICAL TIMING**: Push to 90 HP → Enemy gains Fire → USE ICESPELL!
  - **USE ICESPELL WHEN ENEMY HAS FIRE ELEMENT!**
- FireGolem: FlameStrike adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns, DefensiveStance (+25% def 1 turn, +20% dmg next turn)
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100
- Attack restores +10 MP (total +15 MP per turn when using Attack!)

ENEMY PATTERNS:

FireGolem (180 HP, Def 5):
- Phase 1 (HP > 50%): Neutral element, uses Slam/HeavySlam
- Phase 2 (HP < 50%): Permanently gains Fire element, uses FlameStrike
- FlameStrike inflicts Burn: 10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total damage
- Lifesteal: 20% in Phase 1, 10% in Phase 2
- Telegraphs HeavySlam (45 dmg before defense)

IceWraith (200 HP, Def 8):
- Starts Neutral, gains Ice element for 3 turns after using FrostBlast
- FrostBlast: 22 dmg, grants Ice element (3 turns)
- Debuff: Inflicts AttackDown (-20% damage for 3 turns)
- DefensiveStance: +25% defense for 1 turn, +20% damage next turn
- High defense makes spells more efficient than basic attacks

COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS TO IDENTIFY:
1. **"Heal spam"** - Using Heal when HP > 60% → wasted turns
2. **"Passive play"** - Too much Defend without telegraphs → low DPS
3. **"MP starvation"** - Not using Attack enough → can't afford spells
4. **"Ignoring telegraphs"** - Not Defending against HeavySlam → taking 45 dmg
5. **"Defend vs Debuff over-reliance"** - Defend reduces damage but better to Attack → Cleanse
6. **"Phase blindness"** - Not adapting when enemy changes element
7. **"Wasted turns"** - Defend when safe, Heal when full → closer to 35-turn limit

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **DPS calculation** (Total damage / Total turns - is it above 5+?)
- **Charge efficiency** (did they cash in CHARGED status? or waste it on Defend/Heal?)
- **Cleanse bugs** (did they spam Cleanse without debuffs?)
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they understand when enemy gains/loses element?)
- **Phase transition** (FireGolem HP < 50% → did they switch to IceSpell?)
- **Elemental advantage** (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
  - Enemy has Ice → Use FireSpell (1.5x damage)
  - Enemy has Fire → Use IceSpell (1.5x damage)
  - Enemy has Neutral → Use Attack (no spell bonus)
- **Wrong spell usage** (IceSpell vs Ice element = 0.5x damage, TERRIBLE!)
- **Turn efficiency** (Count wasted turns - every waste = closer to 35-turn limit)
- **Defend strategy** (HeavySlam = must Defend, Debuff = situational, better to Attack → Cleanse)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30)
- Defensive timing (Defend against HeavySlam is critical!)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **FireGolem**

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

## Analysis

The combat highlighted several critical issues with the BT’s strategy against FireGolem. The most significant failure was a consistent lack of defensive reactions to the enemy’s telegraphed HeavySlam attacks. While the BT attempted to heal, it didn’t proactively defend, leading to substantial damage taken. The BT also failed to capitalize on the enemy’s Fire element, consistently using IceSpell when FireSpell would have been far more effective. Finally, MP management was suboptimal; the BT prioritized healing over offensive spells, leading to a premature end.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Proactive Defense against HeavySlam:** Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam. This should be the highest priority, as the BT consistently failed to mitigate the damage from these attacks. This would require a condition check for “Telegraph: HeavySlam” before executing any other action.

2<unused3979> **Elemental Scanning & Spell Selection:** Implement a scan action on turn 1. This action should analyze the enemy’s current element (Fire) and prioritize using FireSpell over IceSpell when appropriate.  This could be triggered on turn 1 and would require a new condition to check the enemy’s element.

3. **Heal Threshold Adjustment:** Increase the heal threshold from 30% to 40%. This would allow the BT to heal more frequently, mitigating the damage taken during the telegraphed attacks.  This could be a simple numerical adjustment in the heal condition.

4. **MP Prioritization Adjustment:** Adjust the MP priority.  Instead of solely focusing on healing, allocate a percentage of MP to offensive spells (FireSpell) when the enemy is in Fire element. This would require a new condition to check the enemy’s element and a percentage-based allocation of MP.

5. **Telegraph Response Delay:** Introduce a 1-turn delay before executing Defend() after a HeavySlam telegraph. This allows the BT to fully register the telegraph and react accordingly, preventing the BT from reacting too late. This could be implemented as a delay timer within the Defend() action.
