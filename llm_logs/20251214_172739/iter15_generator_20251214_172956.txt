SYSTEM PROMPT

You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently defended against the HeavySlam telegraph, which is good. However, it failed to utilize the scan effectively, particularly given the FireGolem’s dynamic element change. The BT relied heavily on the HeavySlam telegraph, and didn’t adapt when the enemy switched to Fire. The MP usage was somewhat inefficient, with frequent heals when a more strategic approach (like waiting for the FireSpell) could have been beneficial.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Prioritize Scanning**: Immediately after turn 1, add a condition to the Scan task that *always* runs, regardless of the current turn. This ensures the enemy’s weakness is identified as quickly as possible.
2. **Conditional IceSpell**: Modify the IceSpell task to *only* execute if the scan reveals the enemy is Fire *and* the player has sufficient MP (35). This prevents wasted MP attempts when the enemy isn’t vulnerable.
3. **Heal Threshold Adjustment**: Increase the heal threshold from 70% to 80%. This will allow for more proactive healing and prevent the player from being caught with critically low HP, especially considering the DoT damage from the FireSpell.
4. **Dynamic Element Awareness**: Add a condition to the IceSpell task that checks if the enemy is currently Fire. If so, the IceSpell should be skipped.
5. **MP Prioritization**:  Adjust the Heal task to only activate if the player's HP falls below 60%. This will reduce unnecessary MP expenditure and allow for more strategic spellcasting.

# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
