You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- Elemental weakness: Fire ↔ Ice (1.5x damage)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
  - FireGolem: Phase 2 (HP < 50%) permanently becomes Fire element
  - IceWraith: Using IceSpell grants Ice element for 3 turns, then returns to Neutral
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
- FireGolem: FireSpell adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES:
- vs FireGolem: Use IceSpell (15 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Fire element (Phase 2)
- vs IceWraith: Use FireSpell (11 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Ice element (after IceSpell)
- Cleanse value: Removes Burn (30 dmg saved) OR AttackDown (damage restored) + 10% boost
- Wrong spell = damage loss (7 vs 11-15)
- **CRITICAL**: Check enemy element BEFORE using elemental spells!

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they wait for enemy to gain element before using weakness spell?)
- Elemental advantage (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **FireGolem**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

RESPONSE

## Analysis

The BT failed to capitalize on the FireGolem's transformation into the Fire element. The most significant issue was the lack of scanning, which meant the player was entirely reliant on luck to use the IceSpell when the enemy was weak to fire. The player repeatedly used FireSpell when the enemy was Fire, and failed to defend against the HeavySlam telegraphs. MP was used inefficiently, with several FireSpells used when a more effective IceSpell was available. The Heal was triggered too late, and the BT didn't prioritize defensive actions against telegraphed attacks.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1:** Add a task to automatically execute a Scan() on turn 1. This ensures the player always knows the enemy's element and weakness.

2. **Defend Against HeavySlam Telegraphs:** Add a condition to the ‘selector’ that triggers a ‘Defend’ task whenever the enemy telegraphs a HeavySlam. This is a critical defensive action.

3. **Prioritize IceSpell when Fire:**  Modify the IceSpell task to have a higher priority than FireSpell.  If the enemy is Fire, immediately execute IceSpell.  This could be achieved by changing the selector's order of execution or adding a higher priority to the IceSpell task.

4. **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 60% to 40%. This will allow the Heal to be triggered sooner, potentially saving the player more HP.

5. **Add MP Cost Consideration to IceSpell:**  Add a condition to the IceSpell task that checks if the player has sufficient MP *before* attempting to execute it. This prevents wasted MP if the player cannot afford the spell.
