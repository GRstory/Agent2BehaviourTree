SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

Generate an IMPROVED Behaviour Tree based on feedback.

# Current Behaviour Tree
```
root :
    selector :
        # Defend against HeavySlam (Highest Priority)
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)
            task : Defend()

        # Scan on Turn 1
        sequence :
            NOT condition : HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : HasMP(15)
            task : Scan()

        sequence :
            condition : IsPlayerHPLow(40)
            condition : CanHeal()
            task : Heal()

        # FireSpell if enemy weak, scanned, affordable, and in phase 2
        sequence :
            condition : EnemyWeakTo(Ice)
            condition : HasScannedEnemy()
            condition : HasMP(20)
            task : FireSpell()

        # IceSpell if enemy weak and affordable

            condition : EnemyWeakTo(Fire)
            condition : HasMP(20)

        # Default: Attack
        task : Attack()
```

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis
The BT consistently used IceSpell, despite the enemy being Ice for 3 turns. This indicates a failure to adapt to the dynamic element. The BT didn’t scan, failing to identify the IceWraith's vulnerability. MP was wasted on repeated IceSpells when a FireSpell would have been more effective. The lack of a defensive response to the FrostTouch was also a critical error.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Implement Scan on Turn 1:** Add a condition to the BT to execute Scan() on turn 1. This will reveal the IceWraith's weakness (Fire) immediately, allowing for a more strategic approach.

2. **Adaptive Spell Selection:** Modify the IceSpell condition to include a check for enemy element. Specifically, if the enemy is Ice, prioritize FireSpell. If enemy is neutral, then IceSpell. This implements a basic adaptive strategy.

3. **Defend against FrostTouch:** Add a Defend() task triggered when the enemy performs FrostTouch. This is a reactive defense against a common attack pattern.

4. **Adjust Heal Threshold:** Increase the heal threshold from 40% to 50%. This will allow for more frequent healing and potentially avoid critical HP drops.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` - Enemy weak to element (DYNAMIC! Can change during combat)
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
