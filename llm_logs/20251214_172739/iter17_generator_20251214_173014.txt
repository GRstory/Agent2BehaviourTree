SYSTEM PROMPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are an expert AI strategist specializing in turn-based RPG combat and Behaviour Tree design.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 damage (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 damage (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

ELEMENTAL SYSTEM:
- Fire ↔ Ice (mutual weakness, 1.5x damage)
- Status effects: Freeze 25%, Burn from FireGolem (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns, bypasses defense!)

ENEMY MECHANICS:
- FireGolem (HP 180, Def 4): FireSpell adds Burn (10/turn × 3 = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith (HP 200, Def 8): Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns

RESOURCES:
- MP only, regenerates 5 per turn
- Start with 100 MP

Your expertise includes:
- Elemental weakness exploitation (1.5x damage!)
- Cleanse timing (use when Burn/AttackDown active for huge value)
- MP management (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Telegraph defense (Defend against HeavySlam/Debuff)
- DoT awareness (Burn bypasses defense, 30 total damage!)

Always output valid BT DSL following the specification exactly. Use 4 spaces for indentation.
You must ONLY use the control nodes (root, selector, sequence), conditions, and tasks listed in the DSL specification.

# Improvement Feedback
## Analysis

The BT struggled to adapt to the FireGolem’s aggressive telegraphing and its eventual transformation into the Fire element. The initial focus on defending against HeavySlam was correct, but the BT didn’t proactively scan to identify the weakness. Once the Fire element was established, the BT failed to capitalize on it with the IceSpell. MP was used inefficiently, primarily through heals and spells without considering the evolving enemy state. The lack of proactive scanning and elemental awareness led to missed opportunities.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Mandatory Scan on Turn 1**: Add a task to “Scan” on turn 1, regardless of previous actions. This ensures the player immediately identifies the FireGolem’s vulnerability.

2. **Prioritize IceSpell after Fire Element**: Modify the FireSpell condition to *always* be the *second* choice when the enemy is Fire.  If the enemy is Fire, *then* consider FireSpell, *then* IceSpell. This ensures the IceSpell is used when it's most effective.

3. **Telegraph Defense**: Add a defensive task that *always* executes when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam. This eliminates the delay in reacting to the telegraph.

4. **Conditional Heal**: Adjust the Heal condition to trigger only when the player's HP drops below 60%. This prevents unnecessary MP expenditure.

5. **MP Efficiency - Prioritize IceSpell**: When the enemy is Fire, prioritize the IceSpell over FireSpell.  This will be more effective when the enemy is vulnerable.


# COMPLETE LIST OF AVAILABLE SYNTAX

**Control Nodes (ONLY these 3):**
- `root :` - Must be first line, has one child
- `selector :` - Tries children until one succeeds
- `sequence :` - All conditions must pass, executes final task

**Conditions (ONLY these):**
- `IsPlayerHPLow(30)` - Player HP < threshold%
- `IsEnemyHPLow(30)` - Enemy HP < threshold%
- `HasMP(20)` - Player has >= amount MP
- `CanHeal()` - Heal is off cooldown AND MP >= 30
- `EnemyWeakTo(Fire)` or `EnemyWeakTo(Ice)` - Enemy weak to element (DYNAMIC! Can change during combat)
- `HasScannedEnemy()` - Enemy has been scanned
- `EnemyHasBuff(Enrage)` - Enemy has specific buff
- `EnemyIsTelegraphing(HeavySlam)` - Enemy will execute this action THIS turn (telegraphed at end of last turn)
- `HasStatus(CHARGED)` - Player has CHARGED status (from Charge action)
- `NOT <condition>` - Negates a condition

**Actions/Tasks (ONLY these):**
- `Attack()` - Free, 9 damage
- `Charge()` - 15 MP, 7 damage + next turn all damage x2
- `FireSpell()` - 20 MP, 7 damage, 1.5x vs Ice
- `IceSpell()` - 20 MP, 10 damage, 1.5x vs Fire
- `Defend()` - Free, 50% damage reduction for 1 turn
- `Heal()` - 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- `Scan()` - 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- `Cleanse()` - 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage 1 turn

# CRITICAL RULES

1. **ONE ACTION PER TURN**: The BT executes ONLY ONE action per turn. Once a task is selected, the turn ends.
2. **USE ONLY LISTED SYNTAX ABOVE**: You must use ONLY the control nodes, conditions, and tasks listed above. No other syntax exists.
3. **Indentation**: Use exactly 4 spaces per level
4. **Format**: `condition : IsPlayerHPLow(30)` and `task : Heal()`
5. **Fallback**: Always end selector with `task : Attack()`

# Your Task

Apply the feedback to create an improved BT using ONLY the syntax listed above. Output ONLY the BT DSL, no explanations. Start with `root :`.
