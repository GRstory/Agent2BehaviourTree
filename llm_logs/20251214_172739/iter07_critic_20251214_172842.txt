You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- Elemental weakness: Fire ↔ Ice (1.5x damage)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
  - FireGolem: Phase 2 (HP < 50%) permanently becomes Fire element
  - IceWraith: Using IceSpell grants Ice element for 3 turns, then returns to Neutral
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
- FireGolem: FireSpell adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES:
- vs FireGolem: Use IceSpell (15 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Fire element (Phase 2)
- vs IceWraith: Use FireSpell (11 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Ice element (after IceSpell)
- Cleanse value: Removes Burn (30 dmg saved) OR AttackDown (damage restored) + 10% boost
- Wrong spell = damage loss (7 vs 11-15)
- **CRITICAL**: Check enemy element BEFORE using elemental spells!

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they wait for enemy to gain element before using weakness spell?)
- Elemental advantage (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **FireGolem**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Analysis
The BT failed to adequately respond to the FireGolem’s aggressive telegraphing and consistent use of FireSpell. The player repeatedly used FireSpell despite the enemy’s constant Fire element and the lack of a scan.  MP was largely wasted on ineffective FireSpells. The defensive actions were reactive rather than proactive, failing to interrupt the enemy’s aggressive attacks.  The BT's reliance on a single, inflexible strategy led to a slow, grinding defeat.

## Improvement Suggestions
1. **Scan on Turn 1**: Immediately upon turn 1, execute a Scan action. This will reveal the enemy’s weakness (Fire) and allow for a more strategic approach.
2. **Proactive Defense**: Add a conditional task to the root that triggers Defend() when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam *and* the enemy element is Fire. This will interrupt the enemy’s attacks.
3. **Prioritize IceSpell**: When the enemy element is Fire, immediately execute IceSpell instead of FireSpell. The 1.5x damage advantage is critical against a FireGolem.
4. **Adjust Heal Threshold**: Increase the HP threshold for the Heal action from 50% to 60%. This will allow for more frequent healing and prevent the player from reaching critical health.
5. **Conditional FireSpell**: Add a condition to the FireSpell task that checks if the enemy element is Fire. If it is, execute the FireSpell. If not, execute IceSpell instead. This prevents wasted MP and maximizes damage output.
