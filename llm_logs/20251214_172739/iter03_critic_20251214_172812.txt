You are a tactical analyst for turn-based RPG combat.

CRITICAL: The Behaviour Tree executes ONE action per turn.

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
- Attack: Free, 9 damage
- Charge: 15 MP, 7 damage + NEXT TURN all damage x2
- FireSpell: 20 MP, 7 dmg (11 vs IceWraith), Burn 25%
- IceSpell: 20 MP, 10 dmg (15 vs FireGolem), Freeze 25%
- Defend: Free, 50% damage reduction
- Heal: 30 MP, +45 HP, 3 turn cooldown
- Scan: 15 MP, reveals enemy weakness
- Cleanse: 25 MP, removes Burn/AttackDown, +10% damage for 1 turn

CRITICAL MECHANICS:
- Elemental weakness: Fire ↔ Ice (1.5x damage)
- **DYNAMIC ELEMENTS**: Enemy elements can CHANGE during combat!
  - Enemies start as Neutral (no weakness)
  - FireGolem: Phase 2 (HP < 50%) permanently becomes Fire element
  - IceWraith: Using IceSpell grants Ice element for 3 turns, then returns to Neutral
  - Elements can expire and return to Neutral
- FireGolem: FireSpell adds Burn (10 dmg/turn × 3 turns = 30 total, bypasses defense!)
- IceWraith: Debuff gives AttackDown -20% for 3 turns
- DoT bypasses defense (Burn is guaranteed 10 dmg/turn)
- MP regenerates 5 per turn, starts at 100

OPTIMAL STRATEGIES:
- vs FireGolem: Use IceSpell (15 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Fire element (Phase 2)
- vs IceWraith: Use FireSpell (11 dmg) ONLY when enemy has Ice element (after IceSpell)
- Cleanse value: Removes Burn (30 dmg saved) OR AttackDown (damage restored) + 10% boost
- Wrong spell = damage loss (7 vs 11-15)
- **CRITICAL**: Check enemy element BEFORE using elemental spells!

Your task is to analyze combat logs and identify:
- **Dynamic element awareness** (did they wait for enemy to gain element before using weakness spell?)
- Elemental advantage (did they use correct spell when enemy had element?)
- Cleanse timing (did they remove Burn/AttackDown when active?)
- MP efficiency (Cleanse 25, Spells 20, Heal 30, Scan 15)
- Defensive timing (Defend against telegraphed HeavySlam/Debuff)
- Heal timing (considering 3 turn cooldown)
- DoT awareness (Burn does 30 total damage, Cleanse saves it all!)

Provide specific, actionable insights for BT improvement.

# Your Task

Analyze the combat and identify:

1. **Telegraph Reactions**: Did they defend against telegraphed heavy attacks?
2. **Elemental Strategy**: Did they scan? Did they use the right spell?
3. **Resource Management**: MP usage efficiency
4. **Defensive Decisions**: Heal/Defend timing
5. **BT Issues**: What parts of the tree caused problems?

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: 
- Focus ONLY on improving strategy against **FireGolem**
- Do NOT add or modify logic for other enemy types you haven't fought
- Only suggest changes based on what happened in THIS combat

Provide 3-5 specific improvement suggestions.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Describe logic changes in plain text, NOT code
- Example: "Add Defend() when enemy telegraphs HeavySlam"
- Example: "Scan on turn 1 instead of turn 2"
- Example: "Increase heal threshold from 30% to 40%"

**Output Format:**

RESPONSE

## Analysis

The BT struggled significantly with adapting to the FireGolem’s aggressive strategy of repeatedly telegraphing HeavySlam attacks and following them with FireSpells. The BT consistently defaulted to attacking and defending without proactively scanning or adjusting its elemental strategy. The MP was largely wasted on attacks and heals when a more strategic approach could have been employed. The lack of a proactive scan led to the FireGolem gaining the Fire element and exploiting it with FireSpells.

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Prioritize Scanning:** Add a condition to the BT to scan the enemy on turn 1. This should be the highest priority action on turn 1, regardless of MP availability, to immediately reveal the enemy’s weakness.

2. **Adaptive Elemental Strategy:** Modify the `FireSpell()` task to only execute *after* a scan has revealed the enemy is vulnerable to Fire. Add a condition: "If enemy is WeakTo(Fire) AND scan has been performed AND MP is available, then execute FireSpell()".

3. **Defend Against HeavySlam:** Add a Defend() task triggered *immediately* when the enemy telegraphs HeavySlam. This should be a high-priority task, potentially even higher than the initial attack, to mitigate the damage.

4. **MP Threshold for Healing:** Adjust the heal threshold from 30% to 40%. This would allow for more frequent healing, which was desperately needed to survive the sustained damage from the FireGolem’s attacks.

5. **Introduce a "Counter-Attack" Option:** If the enemy is telegraphing HeavySlam, add a secondary task to perform a single, quick attack *before* defending. This could interrupt the enemy's rhythm and potentially prevent the HeavySlam.
